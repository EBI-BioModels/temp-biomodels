Description of changes that went into the manual-fixes directory:

* Many SBML files had accidentally exposed the layout annotation as if it was normal layout, which it can only be in SBML L3.  The incorrect namespaces for layout were removed, and the listOfLayouts moved back inside the annotation.

* For Biomodels 872, the _url and _urn versions of the layout annotation had invalid reaction lists, so I replaced them with the reation list from the valid one.

* Removed manual-fixes/BIOMD0000000883/MAP3K8_Thyroid_Spheres_V3.4.cps.xml, since it was just a straight copy of the copasi file (i.e. same name without '.xml' appended.

* Removed 'avogadro' units from Biomodels 965, since avogadro was added for SBML l3, but this was an l2 model.

* Changed 'globalRenderInformation' to 'renderInformation' in two models.
