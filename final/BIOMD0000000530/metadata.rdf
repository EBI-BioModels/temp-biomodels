    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an integral part of gene regulation
    at the post-transcriptional level. Recently, it has been shown
    that pairs of miRNAs can repress the translation of a target
    mRNA in a cooperative manner, which leads to an enhanced
    effectiveness and specificity in target repression. However, it
    remains unclear which miRNA pairs can synergize and which genes
    are target of cooperative miRNA regulation. In this paper, we
    present a computational workflow for the prediction and
    analysis of cooperating miRNAs and their mutual target genes,
    which we refer to as RNA triplexes. The workflow integrates
    methods of miRNA target prediction; triplex structure analysis;
    molecular dynamics simulations and mathematical modeling for a
    reliable prediction of functional RNA triplexes and target
    repression efficiency. In a case study we analyzed the human
    genome and identified several thousand targets of cooperative
    gene regulation. Our results suggest that miRNA cooperativity
    is a frequent mechanism for an enhanced target repression by
    pairs of miRNAs facilitating distinctive and fine-tuned target
    gene expression patterns. Human RNA triplexes predicted and
    characterized in this study are organized in a web resource at
    www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/triplexrna/.</p>
