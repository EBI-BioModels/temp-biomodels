  <strong>Increased glycolytic flux as an outcome of whole-genome duplication in yeast.</strong>

          [2007 ; Volume: 3 (Issue: )]: 129      <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17667951">17667951</a>

  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
          After whole-genome duplication (WGD), deletions return most loci to single copy. However, duplicate loci may survive through selection for increased dosage. Here, we show how the WGD increased copy number of some glycolytic genes could have conferred an almost immediate selective advantage to an ancestor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, providing a rationale for the success of the WGD. We propose that the loss of other redundant genes throughout the genome resulted in incremental dosage increases for the surviving duplicated glycolytic genes. This increase gave post-WGD yeasts a growth advantage through rapid glucose fermentation; one of this lineage&apos;s many adaptations to glucose-rich environments. Our hypothesis is supported by data from enzyme kinetics and comparative genomics. Because changes in gene dosage follow directly from post-WGD deletions, dosage selection can confer an almost instantaneous benefit after WGD, unlike neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization, which require specific mutations. We also show theoretically that increased fermentative capacity is of greatest advantage when glucose resources are both large and dense, an observation potentially related to the appearance of angiosperms around the time of WGD.      </p>

          The parameter      <b>Vmax_PDH</b>
          was corrected by a factor 60 from 6.32 mM/min in the publication to 379.2 mM/min in accordance with the authors.      <br/>

  <p>This model comprises the glycolysis model from Pritchard and Kell (2002) with an extension for the metabolisation of pyruvate in the mitochondria by pyruvate dehydrogenase and an additional parameter,      <b>WGD_E</b>
          , to adjust for the differing enzyme concentrations before the whole genome duplication (WGD).      <br/>
          To switch off transport of pyruvate to the mitochondria, set the parameter      <b>t_m</b>
          = 0.      <br/>
          Figure 2C from the article can be reproduced by manually changing the value of parameter      <b>WGD_E</b>
          in the range between 0.65 and 1.0 and calculating the ratios of ratio of      <b>PDC/PDH</b>
          fluxes in the altered model to the one of the model with      <b>WGD_E</b>
          = 1.      </p>
