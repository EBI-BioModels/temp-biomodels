    <u>NCBS Curation Comments</u>
          This model shows the control mechanism of Jak-Stat pathway, here SOCS1 (Suppressor of cytokine signaling-I) was identified as the negative regulator of Jak and STAT signal transduction pathway. Note: There are a few ambiguities in the paper like initial concentration of IFN and some reactions were missing in the paper that were employed for obtaining the results. The graphs are almost similar to the graphs as shown in the paper but still some ambiguities regarding the concentration are there. Thanks to Dr Satoshi Yamada for clarifying some of those ambiguities and providing the values used in simulations.      </p>

      <u>Biomodels Curation Comments</u>
          The model reproduces Fig 2 (A,C,E,G,I,K,M) of the paper. The set of equations present in the paper are inadequate to reproduce  the figures mentioned . The model appears to have been fine tuned after correspondence between the curators at NCBS and the authors. There is however a slight discrepancy between the simulation results and the plots in the paper. The model was tested on MathSBML.      </p>
