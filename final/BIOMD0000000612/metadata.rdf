    &lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="bibo:abstract"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Bone remodeling is the continuous process of bone resorption
    by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts, in order to
    maintain homeostasis. The activity of osteoclasts and
    osteoblasts is regulated by a network of signaling pathways,
    including Wnt, parathyroid hormone (PTH), RANK
    ligand/osteoprotegrin, and TGF-?, in response to stimuli, such
    as mechanical loading. During aging there is a gradual loss of
    bone mass due to dysregulation of signaling pathways. This may
    be due to a decline in physical activity with age and/or
    changes in hormones and other signaling molecules. In
    particular, hormones, such as PTH, have a circadian rhythm,
    which may be disrupted in aging. Due to the complexity of the
    molecular and cellular networks involved in bone remodeling,
    several mathematical models have been proposed to aid
    understanding of the processes involved. However, to date,
    there are no models, which explicitly consider the effects of
    mechanical loading, the circadian rhythm of PTH, and the
    dynamics of signaling molecules on bone remodeling. Therefore,
    we have constructed a network model of the system using a
    modular approach, which will allow further modifications as
    required in future research. The model was used to simulate the
    effects of mechanical loading and also the effects of different
    interventions, such as continuous or intermittent
    administration of PTH. Our model predicts that the absence of
    regular mechanical loading and/or an impaired PTH circadian
    rhythm leads to a gradual decrease in bone mass over time,
    which can be restored by simulated interventions and that the
    effectiveness of some interventions may depend on their
    timing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
