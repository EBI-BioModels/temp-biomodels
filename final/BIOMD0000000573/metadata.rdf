    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>HIV infection leads to two cell fates, the viral productive
    state or viral latency (a reversible non-productive state). HIV
    latency is relevant because infected active CD4+ T-lymphocytes
    can reach a resting memory state in which the provirus remains
    silent for long periods of time. Despite experimental and
    theoretical efforts, the causal molecular mechanisms
    responsible for HIV latency are only partially understood.
    Studies have determined that HIV latency is influenced by the
    innate immune response carried out by cell restriction factors
    that inhibit the postintegration steps in the virus replication
    cycle. In this study, we present a mathematical study that
    combines deterministic and stochastic approaches to analyze the
    interactions between HIV proteins and the innate immune
    response. Using wide ranges of parameter values, we observed
    the following: (1) a phenomenological description of the viral
    productive and latent cell phenotypes is obtained by bistable
    and bimodal dynamics, (2) biochemical noise reduces the
    probability that an infected cell adopts the latent state, (3)
    the effects of the innate immune response enhance the HIV
    latency state, (4) the conditions of the cell before infection
    affect the latent phenotype, i.e., the existing expression of
    cell restriction factors propitiates HIV latency, and existing
    expression of HIV proteins reduces HIV latency.</p>
