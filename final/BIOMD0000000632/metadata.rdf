    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Excessive DNA damage can induce an irreversible cell cycle
    arrest, called senescence, which is generally perceived as an
    important tumour-suppressor mechanism. However, it is unclear
    how cells decide whether to senesce or not after DNA damage. By
    combining experimental data with a parameterized mathematical
    model we elucidate this cell fate decision at the G1-S
    transition. Our model provides a quantitative and conceptually
    new understanding of how human fibroblasts decide whether DNA
    damage is beyond repair and senesce. Model and data imply that
    the G1-S transition is regulated by a bistable hysteresis
    switch with respect to Cdk2 activity, which in turn is
    controlled by the Cdk2/p21 ratio rather than cyclin abundance.
    We experimentally confirm the resulting predictions that to
    induce senescence i) in healthy cells both high initial and
    elevated background DNA damage are necessary and sufficient,
    and ii) in already damaged cells much lower additional DNA
    damage is sufficient. Our study provides a mechanistic
    explanation of a) how noise in protein abundances allows cells
    to overcome the G1-S arrest even with substantial DNA damage,
    potentially leading to neoplasia, and b) how accumulating DNA
    damage with age increasingly sensitizes cells for
    senescence.</p>
