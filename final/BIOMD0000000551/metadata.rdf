    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Aggregation of the small peptide amyloid beta (A?) into
    oligomers and fibrils in the brain is believed to be a
    precursor to Alzheimer&apos;s disease. A? is produced via multiple
    proteolytic cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP),
    mediated by the enzymes ?- and ?-secretase. In this study, we
    examine the temporal dynamics of soluble (unaggregated) A? in
    the plasma and cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) of rhesus monkeys
    treated with different oral doses of a ?-secretase inhibitor. A
    dose-dependent reduction of A? concentration was observed
    within hours of drug ingestion, for all doses tested. A?
    concentration in the CSF returned to its predrug level over the
    monitoring period. In contrast, A? concentration in the plasma
    exhibited an unexpected overshoot to as high as 200% of the
    predrug concentration, and this overshoot persisted as late as
    72 hours post-drug ingestion. To account for these
    observations, we proposed and analyzed a minimal physiological
    model for A? dynamics that could fit the data. Our analysis
    suggests that the overshoot arises from the attenuation of an
    A? clearance mechanism, possibly due to the inhibitor. Our
    model predicts that the efficacy of A? clearance recovers to
    its basal (pretreatment) value with a characteristic time of
    &gt;48 hours, matching the time-scale of the overshoot. These
    results point to the need for a more detailed investigation of
    soluble A? clearance mechanisms and their interaction with
    A?-reducing drugs.</p>
