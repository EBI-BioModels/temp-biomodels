    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Recent experimental data have shown that HIV-specific CD4 T
    cells provide a very important target for HIV replication. We
    use mathematical models to explore the effect of specific CD4 T
    cell infection on the dynamics of virus spread and immune
    responses. Infected CD4 T cells can provide antigen for their
    own stimulation. We show that such autocatalytic cell division
    can significantly enhance virus spread, and can also provide an
    additional reservoir for virus persistence during anti-viral
    drug therapy. In addition, the initial number of HIV-specific
    CD4 T cells is an important determinant of acute infection
    dynamics. A high initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can
    lead to a sudden and fast drop of the population of
    HIV-specific CD4 T cells which results quickly in their
    extinction. On the other hand, a low initial number of
    HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a prolonged persistence of
    HIV-specific CD4 T cell help at higher levels. The model
    suggests that boosting the population of HIV-specific CD4 T
    cells can increase the amount of virus-induced immune
    impairment, lead to less efficient anti-viral effector
    responses, and thus speed up disease progression, especially if
    effector responses such as CTL have not been sufficiently
    boosted at the same time.</p>
