    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Under favorable conditions, many proteins can assemble into
    macroscopically large aggregates such as the amyloid fibrils
    that are associated with Alzheimer&apos;s, Parkinson&apos;s, and other
    neurological and systemic diseases. The overall process of
    protein aggregation is characterized by initial lag time during
    which no detectable aggregation occurs in the solution and by
    maximal aggregation rate at which the dissolved protein
    converts into aggregates. In this study, the correlation
    between the lag time and the maximal rate of protein
    aggregation is analyzed. It is found that the product of these
    two quantities depends on a single numerical parameter, the
    kinetic index of the curve quantifying the time evolution of
    the fraction of protein aggregated. As this index depends
    relatively little on the conditions and/or system studied, our
    finding provides insight into why for many experiments the
    values of the product of the lag time and the maximal
    aggregation rate are often equal or quite close to each other.
    It is shown how the kinetic index is related to a basic kinetic
    parameter of a recently proposed theory of protein
    aggregation.</p>
