kinetics in Parkinson&apos;s</div>
  <div class="dc:description">
    <pre>
This theoretical model uses 2-step Finke-Watzky (FW) kinetics
todescribe the production, misfolding, aggregation, transport and
degradation of α-syn that may lead to Parkinson&apos;s Disease
(PD). Deregulated α-syn degradation is predicted to be
crucialfor PD pathogenesis.

    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The aim of this paper is to develop a minimal model
    describing events leading to the onset of Parkinson&apos;s disease
    (PD). The model accounts for α-synuclein (α-syn) production in
    the soma, transport toward the synapse, misfolding, and
    aggregation. The production and aggregation of polymeric α-syn
    is simulated using a minimalistic 2-step Finke-Watzky model. We
    utilized the developed model to analyze what changes in a
    healthy neuron are likely to lead to the onset of α-syn
    aggregation. We checked the effects of interruption of α-syn
    transport toward the synapse, entry of misfolded (infectious)
    α-syn into the somatic and synaptic compartments, increasing
    the rate of α-syn synthesis in the soma, and failure of α-syn
    degradation machinery. Our model suggests that failure of α-syn
    degradation machinery is probably the most likely cause for the
    onset of α-syn aggregation leading to PD.</p>
