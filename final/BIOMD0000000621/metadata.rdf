          This is the model with healthy state initial conditions. A few changes were made to the model equations in order to bypass the circular dependencies apparent in SBML. Coupled algebraic equations for the species Glucose, Insulin and Proinsulin were changed to reactions which represent the ordinary differential equations found in a previously published model by <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/18780774">De Gaetano
et al (2008)</a>, <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/MODEL1112110003" title="BioModels Entry">[MODEL1112110003]</a>. This reference was used by the present authors for the algebraic equations.

      <p>
Recent clinical studies suggest sustained treatment effects of interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-blocking therapies in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The underlying mechanisms of these effects, however, remain underexplored. Using a quantitative systems pharmacology modeling approach, we combined ex vivo data of IL-1β effects on β-cell function and turnover with a disease progression model of the long-term interactions between insulin, glucose, and β-cell mass in type 2 diabetes mellitus. We then simulated treatment effects of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra. The result was a substantial and partly sustained symptomatic improvement in β-cell function, and hence also in HbA1C, fasting plasma glucose, and proinsulin-insulin ratio, and a small increase in β-cell mass. We propose that improved β-cell function, rather than mass, is likely to explain the main IL-1β-blocking effects seen in current clinical data, but that improved β-cell mass might result in disease-modifying effects not clearly distinguishable until &gt;1 year after treatment.
