  <p>The model is according to the paper      <i>Endothelin Action on Pituitary Lactotrophs: One Receptor, Many GTP-Binding Proteins</i>
          Figure 1 has been simulated by MathSBML. The figure for the [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]ER have been normalized in the paper.Original model comes from http://www.math.fsu.edu/~bertram/software/pituitary      </p>
  <p>The units for parameters and species are varied from one to another, so I omit the unit definition here . Conductances in pS; currents in fA; Ca concentrations in uM; time in ms</p>
