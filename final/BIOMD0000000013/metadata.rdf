  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
In this paper some of the general concepts underpinning the computer modelling of metabolic systems are introduced. The difference between kinetic and structural modelling is emphasized, and the more important techniques from both, along with the physiological implications, are described. These approaches are then illustrated by descriptions of other work, in which they have been applied to models of the Calvin cycle, sucrose metabolism in sugar cane, and starch metabolism in potatoes.

  <p> This model describes the non oxidative Calvin cycle as depicted in Poolman et al; J Exp Bot (2004) 55:1177-1186, fig 2. Reaction E20: E4P + F6P ↔  S7P + GAP, is depicted in the figure, but not included in the model. The light reaction: ADP + P
        <sub>i</sub> → ATP, is included in the model, but only mentioned in the figure caption. The parameters and initial concentrations are the same as in Poolman, 1999, Computer Modelling Applied to the Calvin Cycle, PhD Thesis, Oxford Brookes University, Appendix A (available at at

Based on a description by Pettersson 1988, Eur. J. Biochem. 175, 661-672
        <br/>
Differences are:
        <br/>
1 - Reactions assumed by Pettersson to be in equilibrium have fast mass action kinetics.
        <br/>
2 - Introduction of the parameter PGAxpMult to modulate PGA export through TPT.
        <br/>
3 - Introduction of Starch phosphorylase reaction.
