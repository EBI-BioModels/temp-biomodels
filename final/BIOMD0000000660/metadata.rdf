    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Following DNA damage caused by exogenous sources, such as
    ionizing radiation, the tumour suppressor p53 mediates cell
    cycle arrest via expression of the CDK inhibitor, p21. However,
    the role of p21 in maintaining genomic stability in the absence
    of exogenous DNA-damaging agents is unclear. Here, using live
    single-cell measurements of p21 protein in proliferating
    cultures, we show that naturally occurring DNA damage incurred
    over S-phase causes p53-dependent accumulation of p21 during
    mother G2- and daughter G1-phases. High p21 levels mediate G1
    arrest via CDK inhibition, yet lower levels have no impact on
    G1 progression, and the ubiquitin ligases CRL4Cdt2 and SCFSkp2
    couple to degrade p21 prior to the G1/S transition.
    Mathematical modelling reveals that a bistable switch, created
    by CRL4Cdt2, promotes irreversible S-phase entry by keeping p21
    levels low, preventing premature S-phase exit upon DNA damage.
    Thus, we characterize how p21 regulates the
    proliferation-quiescence decision to maintain genomic
    stability.</p>
