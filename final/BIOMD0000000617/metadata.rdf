    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Reproducibility of biological data is a significant problem
    in research today. One potential contributor to this, which has
    received little attention, is the over complication of enzyme
    kinetic inhibition models. The over complication of inhibitory
    models stems from the common use of the inhibitory term (1 +
    [I]/Ki ), an equilibrium binding term that does not distinguish
    between inhibitor binding and inhibitory effect. Since its
    initial appearance in the literature, around a century ago, the
    perceived mechanistic methods used in its production have
    spurred countless inhibitory equations. These equations are
    overly complex and are seldom compared to each other, which has
    destroyed their usefulness resulting in the proliferation and
    regulatory acceptance of simpler models such as IC50s for drug
    characterization. However, empirical analysis of inhibitory
    data recognizing the clear distinctions between inhibitor
    binding and inhibitory effect can produce simple logical
    inhibition models. In contrast to the common divergent practice
    of generating new inhibitory models for every inhibitory
    situation that presents itself. The empirical approach to
    inhibition modeling presented here is broadly applicable
    allowing easy comparison and rational analysis of drug
    interactions. To demonstrate this, a simple kinetic model of
    DAPT, a compound that both activates and inhibits ?-secretase
    is examined using excel. The empirical kinetic method described
    here provides an improved way of probing disease mechanisms,
    expanding the investigation of possible therapeutic
    interventions.</p>
