    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate a variety of intracellular pathways through their ability to promote the binding of GTP to heterotrimeric G proteins. Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins increases the intrinsic GTPase activity of Galpha-subunits and are widely regarded as negative regulators of G protein signaling. Using yeast we demonstrate that GTP hydrolysis is not only required for desensitization, but is essential for achieving a high maximal (saturated level) response. Thus RGS-mediated GTP hydrolysis acts as both a negative (low stimulation) and positive (high stimulation) regulator of signaling. To account for this we generated a new kinetic model of the G protein cycle where Galpha(GTP) enters an inactive GTP-bound state following effector activation. Furthermore, in vivo and in silico experimentation demonstrates that maximum signaling output first increases and then decreases with RGS concentration. This unimodal, non-monotone dependence on RGS concentration is novel. Analysis of the kinetic model has revealed a dynamic network motif that shows precisely how inclusion of the inactive GTP-bound state for the Galpha produces this unimodal relationship.</p>

    <p>To reproduce dose-response plots in the publication, the model is simulated with 12 different concentrations (see parameter Ligand_conc). For each concentration, a single value must be obtained from the integral of the trajectory of species z3 from time=0 to time=30. These values are then used to build a dose-response plot (authors used GraphPad Prism). Mutant strains are simulated with alternative parameter values or initial conditions in Table S3.</p>
