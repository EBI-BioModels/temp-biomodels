    dc:description """<body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>The model reproduces Fig 3a of the paper. Please note that the authors mention that they used a value of 2 for n, n being the power in the positive feedback function for kinase autocatalysis, however the model here has n=1.95 because this results in a simulation that is identical to Fig 3a. The model was successfully tested on MathSBML.</p>
