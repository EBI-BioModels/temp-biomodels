    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>In this paper, we propose and analyse a mathematical model
    for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a cancer of the blood.
    We model the interaction between naive T cells, effector T
    cells, and CML cancer cells in the body, using a system of
    ordinary differential equations which gives rates of change of
    the three cell populations. One of the difficulties in modeling
    CML is the scarcity of experimental data which can be used to
    estimate parameters values. To compensate for the resulting
    uncertainties, we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) on large
    ranges of possible parameter values in our analysis. A major
    goal of this work is the determination of parameters which play
    a critical role in remission or clearance of the cancer in the
    model. Our analysis examines 12 parameters, and identifies two
    of these, the growth and death rates of CML, as critical to the
    outcome of the system. Our results indicate that the most
    promising research avenues for treatments of CML should be
    those that affect these two significant parameters (CML growth
    and death rates), while altering the other parameters should
    have little effect on the outcome.</p>
