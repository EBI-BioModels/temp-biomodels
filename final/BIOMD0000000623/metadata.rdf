  <div class="dc:title">Orton2009 - Modelling cancerous mutations in
the EGFR/ERK pathway - EGF Model</div>
  <div class="dc:description">This model studies the aberrations in
ERK signalling for different cancer mutations. The authors alter a
previously existing EGF model (Brown et al 2004) to include new
interactions that better fit empirical data.
Predictions show that the ERK signalling is a robust mechanism
taking different courses for different cancer mutations. Most
parameter values are used from the previous model and the new
parameters are estimated using experimental data performed by
the authors on PC12 cells (adrenal gland, rat). The authors
provide an SBML version of the model in the paper.</div>

    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activated
    Extracellular-signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) pathway is a
    critical cell signalling pathway that relays the signal for a
    cell to proliferate from the plasma membrane to the nucleus.
    Deregulation of the EGFR/ERK pathway due to alterations
    affecting the expression or function of a number of pathway
    components has long been associated with numerous forms of
    cancer. Under normal conditions, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)
    stimulates a rapid but transient activation of ERK as the
    signal is rapidly shutdown. Whereas, under cancerous mutation
    conditions the ERK signal cannot be shutdown and is sustained
    resulting in the constitutive activation of ERK and continual
    cell proliferation. In this study, we have used computational
    modelling techniques to investigate what effects various
    cancerous alterations have on the signalling flow through the
    ERK pathway.We have generated a new model of the EGFR activated
    ERK pathway, which was verified by our own experimental data.
    We then altered our model to represent various cancerous
    situations such as Ras, B-Raf and EGFR mutations, as well as
    EGFR overexpression. Analysis of the models showed that
    different cancerous situations resulted in different signalling
    patterns through the ERK pathway, especially when compared to
    the normal EGF signal pattern. Our model predicts that
    cancerous EGFR mutation and overexpression signals almost
    exclusively via the Rap1 pathway, predicting that this pathway
    is the best target for drugs. Furthermore, our model also
    highlights the importance of receptor degradation in normal and
    cancerous EGFR signalling, and suggests that receptor
    degradation is a key difference between the signalling from the
    EGF and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) receptors.Our results suggest
    that different routes to ERK activation are being utilised in
    different cancerous situations which therefore has interesting
    implications for drug selection strategies. We also conducted a
    comparison of the critical differences between signalling from
    different growth factor receptors (namely EGFR, mutated EGFR,
    NGF, and Insulin) with our results suggesting the difference
    between the systems are large scale and can be attributed to
    the presence/absence of entire pathways rather than subtle
    difference in individual rate constants between the
    systems.</p>
