    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Studies in animals and humans suggest that the diurnal
    pattern in plasma melatonin levels is due to the hormone&apos;s
    rates of synthesis, circulatory infusion and clearance,
    circadian control of synthesis onset and offset, environmental
    lighting conditions, and error in the melatonin immunoassay. A
    two-dimensional linear differential equation model of the
    hormone is formulated and is used to analyze plasma melatonin
    levels in 18 normal healthy male subjects during a constant
    routine. Recently developed Bayesian statistical procedures are
    used to incorporate correctly the magnitude of the immunoassay
    error into the analysis. The estimated parameters [median
    (range)] were clearance half-life of 23.67 (14.79-59.93) min,
    synthesis onset time of 2206 (1940-0029), synthesis offset time
    of 0621 (0246-0817), and maximum N-acetyltransferase activity
    of 7.17(2.34-17.93) pmol x l(-1) x min(-1). All were in good
    agreement with values from previous reports. The difference
    between synthesis offset time and the phase of the core
    temperature minimum was 1 h 15 min (-4 h 38 min-2 h 43 min).
    The correlation between synthesis onset and the dim light
    melatonin onset was 0.93. Our model provides a more
    physiologically plausible estimate of the melatonin synthesis
    onset time than that given by the dim light melatonin onset and
    the first reliable means of estimating the phase of synthesis
    offset. Our analysis shows that the circadian and
    pharmacokinetics parameters of melatonin can be reliably
    estimated from a single model.</p>
