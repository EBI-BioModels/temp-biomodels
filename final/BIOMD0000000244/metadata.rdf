  &lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
	 The recognition of carbon sources and the regulatory adjustments to recognized changes are of particular importance for bacterial survival in fluctuating environments. Despite a thorough knowledge base of Escherichia coli&amp;apos;s central metabolism and its regulation, fundamental aspects of the employed sensing and regulatory adjustment mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, using a differential equation model that couples enzymatic and transcriptional regulation of E. coli&amp;apos;s central metabolism, we show that the interplay of known interactions explains in molecular-level detail the system-wide adjustments of metabolic operation between glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources. We show that these adaptations are enabled by an indirect recognition of carbon sources through a mechanism we termed distributed sensing of intracellular metabolic fluxes. This mechanism uses two general motifs to establish flux-signaling metabolites, whose bindings to transcription factors form flux sensors. As these sensors are embedded in global feedback loop architectures, closed-loop self-regulation can emerge within metabolism itself and therefore, metabolic operation may adapt itself autonomously (not requiring upstream sensing and signaling) to fluctuating carbon sources.
	&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
In its current form this SBML model is parametrized for the glucose to acetate transition and to simulate the extended diauxic shift as shown in figure 3 and scenario 6 of the attached matlab file. In this scenario the cells first are grown from an OD600 (BM) of 0.03 with a starting glucose concentration of 0.5 g/l for 8.15 h (29340 sec). Then a medium containing 5 g/l acetate is inoculated with these cells to an OD600 of 0.03 and grown for another 19.7 hours (70920 sec). Finally the cells are shifted to a medium containing both glucose and acetate at a concentration of 3 g/l with a starting OD600 of 0.0005.&lt;br/&gt;
The shifts where implemented using events triggering at the times determined by the parameters &lt;em&gt;shift1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;shift2&lt;/em&gt; (in hours). To simulate other scenarios the initial conditions need to be changed as described in the supplemental materials (&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v6/n1/extref/msb201010-s1.pdf"&gt;supplement 1&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt; 
The original SBML model and the MATLAB file used for the calculations can be down loaded as supplementary materials of the publication from the MSB website. (&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v6/n1/extref/msb201010-s2.zip"&gt;supplement 2&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
The units of the external metabolites are in [g/l], those of the biomass in optical density,OD&lt;sub&gt;600&lt;/sub&gt;, taken as dimensionless, and [micromole/(gramm dry weight)] for all intracellular metabolites. As the latter cannot be implemented in SBML, it was chosen to be micromole only and the units of the parameters are left mostly undefined.   
&lt;/p&gt;
