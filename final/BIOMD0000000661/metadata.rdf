    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>One proposed mechanism of tumour escape from immune
    surveillance is tumour up-regulation of the cell surface ligand
    FasL, which can lead to apoptosis of Fas receptor (Fas)
    positive lymphocytes. Based upon this &apos;counterattack&apos;, we have
    developed a mathematical model involving tumour cell-lymphocyte
    interaction, cell surface expression of Fas/FasL, and their
    secreted soluble forms. The model predicts that (a) the
    production of soluble forms of Fas and FasL will lead to the
    down-regulation of the immune response; (b) matrix
    metalloproteinase (MMP) inactivation should lead to increased
    membrane FasL and result in a higher rate of Fas-mediated
    apoptosis for lymphocytes than for tumour cells. Recent studies
    on cancer patients lend support for these predictions. The
    clinical implications are two-fold. Firstly, the use of broad
    spectrum MMP inhibitors as anti-angiogenic agents may be
    compromised by their adverse effect on tumour FasL
    up-regulation. Also, Fas/FasL interactions may have an impact
    on the outcome of numerous ongoing immunotherapeutic trials
    since the final common pathway of all these approaches is the
    transduction of death signals within the tumour cell.</p>
