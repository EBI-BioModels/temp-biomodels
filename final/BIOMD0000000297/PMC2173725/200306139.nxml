Central to the checkpoint mechanism is Swe1 kinase: normally inactive, its activation halts cell cycle progression in G2. We propose a molecular network for Swe1 control, based on published observations of budding yeast and analogous control signals in fission yeast. The proposed Swe1 network is merged with a model of cyclin-dependent kinase regulation, converted into a set of differential equations and studied by numerical simulation. The simulations accurately reproduce the phenotypes of a dozen checkpoint mutants. Among other predictions, the model attributes a new role to Hsl1, a kinase known to play a role in Swe1 degradation: Hsl1 must also be indirectly responsible for potent inhibition of Swe1 activity. The model supports the idea that the morphogenesis checkpoint, like other checkpoints, raises the cell size threshold for progression from one phase of the cell cycle to the next.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>molecular networks; dynamical systems; cell cycle; size control; Swe1 kinase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>The online version of this article contains supplemental material.</p></fn><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: MPF, M-phase promoting factor; ND, nuclear division.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>During the cell division cycle, a cell first replicates its hereditary material (S phase) and then segregates the chromosomes to the newborn daughter cells (mitosis). Alternation of mitosis and DNA replication is necessary for the cycle to be successful: two consecutive rounds of mitosis cause lethal mis-segregation of the genome, and successive rounds of DNA synthesis are usually disadvantageous (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Enoch and Nurse, 1991</xref>). In molecular terms, the proper order of the events is ensured by the alternation of different Cdk activities (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Morgan 1995</xref>). Cdk activities are subject to multiple controls: they are activated by binding to cyclins, and they can be inhibited by tyrosine phosphorylation or by stoichiometric binding with a Cdk inhibitor (Sic1 in budding yeast). Waves of different classes of cyclins alternate during the cycle, and the resulting Cdk&#x02013;cyclin complexes are responsible for various cell cycle events. In budding yeast (where the cell-cycle regulating Cdk is Cdc28), the first complex to arise during the cycle is Cdc28&#x02013;Cln3, which senses growth of the cell in G1, followed by Cdc28&#x02013;Cln1 and Cdc28&#x02013;Cln2, which are responsible for bud initiation and spindle pole body duplication. They are followed by Cdc28&#x02013;Clb5 and Cdc28&#x02013;Clb6, which are primarily responsible for S phase, and finally by the mitotic complexes Cdc28&#x02013;Clb1 and Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2.</p><p>The main transitions of the cell division process&#x02014;the onset of DNA replication (Start), entry into mitosis (G2-M transition), and exit from mitosis&#x02014;are controlled by surveillance mechanisms, also known as checkpoints (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hartwell and Weinert, 1989</xref>). The G2-M checkpoint plays a major role in fission yeast (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>), where it forestalls mitosis until the cell grows to a critical size and properly replicates its DNA (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Nurse, 1999</xref>). The molecular events which control this transition are the inhibitory phosphorylation of tyrosine-15 of Cdc2 (the fission yeast homologue of Cdc28), executed by the protein kinase Wee1, and the activating dephosphorylation of this site, catalyzed by the phosphatase Cdc25. If DNA is damaged or not properly replicated, the checkpoint is engaged, Cdc2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine-15, and cell cycle progression is halted. The inhibitory phosphorylation is relieved when DNA is fully replicated or the damage is repaired (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Enoch and Nurse, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Budding yeast contains homologues of Wee1 and Cdc25, known respectively as Swe1 kinase (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Booher et al., 1993</xref>) and Mih1 phosphatase (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 1989</xref>). But in budding yeast, Mih1 and Swe1 are not used to check cell size, nor are they involved in monitoring DNA replication, as evidenced by the fact that cells containing a mutant form of Cdc28 lacking the tyrosine phosphorylation site are still perfectly viable in the presence of inhibitors of DNA synthesis (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Amon et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Sorger and Murray, 1992</xref>). Recently, Lew and coworkers have shown in an elegant series of papers that these tyrosine phosphorylation&#x02013;dephosphorylation reactions in budding yeast are involved in a different kind of checkpoint, called the morphogenesis checkpoint (for review see <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Lew, 2000</xref>). This surveillance mechanism halts cell cycle progression when bud formation is impaired, which is a plausible event for yeast cells growing in natural conditions because several external stimuli (such as heat shock and osmotic shock) are able to arrest or delay the formation of a bud (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Sia et al., 1998</xref>). By arresting or delaying cell cycle progression, the morphogenesis checkpoint prevents formation of dinucleated cells, which are less viable than mononucleated cells (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Sia et al., 1996</xref>). The arrest is not complete; after several hours, unbudded cells undergo mitosis (called &#x0201c;adaptation&#x0201d;) and become dinucleate (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Sia et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we propose a molecular network for the morphogenesis checkpoint, based largely on Lew's work (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Lew, 2000</xref>), and we translate it into a set of differential equations. Our main goal is to explain the observed properties of cells under checkpoint-free and checkpoint-induced conditions in terms of the temporal dynamics of the underlying molecular regulatory system. The model provides a common framework for describing many diverse features of the checkpoint; not only G2 delay, but also adaptation and cell death. The model also suggests a number of experiments that would be especially revealing about the molecular regulatory system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>A mathematical model</title><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> and online supplemental material (Experimental basis of the model, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200306139/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200306139/DC1</ext-link>), we summarize the experimental results that support a hypothetical molecular mechanism for the morphogenesis checkpoint, based on posttranslational modification of Swe1. Obviously, the checkpoint mechanism cannot be separated from the whole network of cell-cycle regulatory proteins. Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 is the key regulator of mitosis and as such it is the main target of Swe1 kinase activity, but there are other connections. For example, the transcription factor SBF controls Swe1 expression as well as Cln1-2 expression; and bud formation, needed for Hsl1 activation, is due to Cdc28&#x02013;Cln1-2. Therefore, if we want to model the morphogenesis checkpoint, we must start with a model of the cell cycle engine.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table I.</label><caption><title>Comparing experiments and simulations</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="bottom"/><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"/><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"/><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"/><th colspan="6" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="bottom">Nuclear division time

<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Tyson and Novak (2001)</xref> have proposed a simplified version (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) of a model by <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2000)</xref> of the budding yeast cell cycle. In the Tyson-Novak model, Cln1, Cln2, Clb5, and Clb6 are lumped together as &#x0201c;Cln&#x0201d;, and Clb1 and Clb2 are lumped together as &#x0201c;Clb2&#x0201d;. Cln synthesis is due to SBF, and therefore is a function of cell size (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dirick et al., 1995</xref>). Cln-dependent kinase activity induces degradation of Sic1, and initiates DNA synthesis (via Clb5-6). Moreover, Cln-dependent kinase activity inactivates Cdh1, permitting Clb2 level to rise. Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 activity, relieved from Sic1 and Cdh1 inhibition, turns on its own transcription through Mcm1, and turns off Cln transcription by inhibiting SBF. The cell enters into M phase, and Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 starts a negative feedback loop by activating a putative intermediate enzyme, and by enhancing Cdc20 transcription. The ultimate effect of the loop is to activate the anaphase promoting complex, which degrades Clb2 and drives the cell out of mitosis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>

Notice that Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 has two major antagonists, Sic1 and Cdh1. In G1 phase, Sic1 and Cdh1 are active and Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 is repressed, and vice versa in S-G2-M. Cln- dependent kinase activity pushes the engine from G1 to S-G2-M by inactivating Sic1 and Cdh1. Cln synthesis turns on when the cell grows to a critical size, because Mass activates SBF. The transition from S-G2-M back to G1 is driven by Cdc20, which targets Clb2 for degradation and (indirectly) activates Cdh1.

<bold>The Swe1 box.</bold> Swe1 can be present in four different forms during the cell cycle: unchanged (Swe1), phosphorylated by Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 (PSwe1); or modified by Hsl1 (Swe1M) or both (PSwe1M). The doubly modified form we assume to be less stable than the others. The unphosphorylated, unmodified form of Swe1 is assumed to be most active in phosphorylating Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2. Cdc28 is dephosphorylated by Mih1. We assume that Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 phosphorylates and activates Mih1, and MAPK (Mpk1) inactivates Mih1.

Second, we do not keep track of Hsl1 synthesis, degradation, and activation. Because Hsl1 activation depends on bud presence, we assume that when the bud is formed, Hsl1 is able to &#x0201c;modify&#x0201d; Swe1 (Swe1M denotes the modified form of Swe1). The nature of this modification is not clear, as Swe1 does not appear to be a substrate for Hsl1 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cid et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Theesfeld et al., 2003</xref>). Whatever the modification may be, we assume that it does not affect Swe1 stability but makes Swe1 inactive (0.5% of the fully active form). Finally, we ignore Hsl7 because Hsl1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step for Swe1 modification (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">McMillan et al., 1999a</xref>). Many other proteins are involved in this step (septins, Kcc4, Gin4, Cla4, and Nap1), but again, as a first approximation, we ignore them.</p></sec><sec><title>Swe1.</title><p>Swe1 does not play a major role during the normal cell cycle of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> even though it is able to phosphorylate Cdc28 on tyrosine-19 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Booher et al., 1993</xref>). The cell cycle is perfectly normal in <italic>swe1</italic>&#x00394; (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Booher et al., 1993</xref>). Nonetheless, Swe1 can affect cell cycle progression, as <italic>swe1</italic>&#x00394; cells are slightly smaller than wild-type cells (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Harvey and Kellogg, 2003</xref>), and Swe1 overexpression (<italic>GAL-SWE1</italic>, wild-type gene controlled by a GAL promoter) leads to a G2 block and very elongated buds (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Booher et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 phosphorylates Swe1 in vitro (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">McMillan et al., 2002</xref>), and we assume that Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 catalyzes the same reaction in vivo (we call the phosphorylated form PSwe1). We assume that PSwe1 has 10% of Swe1 kinase activity.</p><p>Swe1 is degraded by proteasomes, after polyubiquitination by the Skp1&#x02013;Cdc53&#x02013;F-box protein complex (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 1998</xref>). We assume that Swe1, like other substrates of this complex, must be phosphorylated in order to be ubiquitinated. The phosphorylation we assume to be necessary but not sufficient (i.e., PSwe1 is as stable as Swe1). Efficient degradation of Swe1, we assume, requires modification by both Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 and Hsl1 (i.e., PSwe1M is both catalytically inactive and highly unstable).</p><p>In the model, Hsl1 and Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 act along the same degradation pathway, each introducing a different posttranslational modification in Swe1. Either modification alone renders Swe1 less active, whereas both are needed to make it unstable. Based on recent data (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">McMillan et al., 2002</xref>), we assume that these two modifications can occur in either order, although Hsl1 acts first in wild-type cells. The four different forms (Swe1, Swe1M, PSwe1, and PSwe1M) comprise the &#x0201c;Swe1 box&#x0201d; in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.</p><p>The antagonistic relationship between Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 and Swe1 is at the core of our model of the morphogenesis checkpoint. When the checkpoint is induced, Swe1 phosphorylates and inhibits Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Booher et al., 1993</xref>). (Swe1 can also function as a stoichiometric inhibitor of Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">McMillan et al., 1999b</xref>], but we do not keep track of this effect in the model.) On the other hand, Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 down-regulates Swe1 in three ways. By phosphorylating Swe1, it reduces Swe1 activity and prepares Swe1 for degradation. In addition, Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 inhibits the transcription factor, SBF, and thereby shuts off synthesis of Swe1. If Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 successfully down-regulates Swe1, then the cell proceeds into mitosis. If Swe1 successfully inhibits Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2, then the cell arrests in G2 phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Mih1.</title><p>In frog egg extracts (where the homologues of Mih1 and Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 are called Cdc25 and M-phase promoting factor [MPF]), Cdc25 has been shown to be involved in a positive feedback loop with MPF, whereby MPF activates Cdc25 by phosphorylation, and Cdc25 activates MPF by dephosphorylating it (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Izumi et al., 1992</xref>).

Rather than introduce a full MAPK pathway, we simply assume that the rate constants characterizing Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 dephosphorylation by Mih1 are decreased 10-fold as an effect of Mpk1 activation, in response to bud failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Equations and parameters.</title><p>The wiring diagrams of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> have been translated into a set of ordinary differential equation (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200306139/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200306139/DC1</ext-link>) using mass-action kinetics for the most part.

Our variables are concentrations, but bud formation, nuclear division (ND) and cell death are the experimental observables. We have adopted the following six rules to relate our calculations to experimental observations: (1) cell size increases exponentially (<italic>M</italic> = <italic>M</italic>
<sub>0</sub>e<italic><sup>&#x003bc;t</sup></italic>, <italic>&#x003bc;</italic> = specific growth rate). Cell division (<italic>M</italic> &#x02192; <italic>M</italic>/2) occurs when Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 decreases below a threshold, [Clb2] = 0.2; (2) we introduce a variable [BE] that represents the extent of phosphorylation of proteins targeted by Cdc28&#x02013;Cln. We assume that a bud is formed ([BUD] = 1) and Hsl1 is activated when [BE] increases above a threshold value (0.6). The bud is removed ([BUD] = 0) and Hsl1 is inactivated when the cell divides. We model <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; by setting <italic>k</italic>
<sub>hsl1</sub> = 0; (3) the MAPK signal is modeled by reducing the activity of Mih1 by 90% (<italic>k</italic>
<sup>&#x02032;</sup>
<sub>mih</sub> = 0.5, <italic>k</italic>
<sup>&#x02032;&#x02032;</sup>
<sub>mih</sub> = 0.05); (4) most experiments report the percentage of cells that undergo ND as a function of time. Because our model is deterministic, all cells divide at the same time. We identify the experimental time when 50% of the cells have undergone ND with the time in the model when anaphase occurs, i.e., when Cdc20 is activated (increases above a threshold value of 0.3); (5) experimentally, cell synchronization is obtained by treating cells for 2&#x02013;3 h with &#x003b1;-factor, and then releasing them from the block. We simulate this experiment by allowing growth for 120 min at one half the specific growth rate of normal cells, and setting SBF activity to 0, so that <italic>CLN</italic> and <italic>SWE1</italic> are not transcribed (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Sia et al., 1996</xref>). The variables at the end of the 120 min simulation are used as the initial conditions for the ND timing experiment. In some experiments, synchronization was obtained by elutriation. In this case, we choose our initial conditions at the minimum mass value of a regular cell cycle; and (6) we use the following rule to determine whether the cell is viable or not: a mononucleated cell (dinucleated cell) is dead if its size exceeds four times (five times) the size of a wild-type cell at division.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Kinetic data in <italic>cdc24<sup>ts</sup></italic> background strains</title><p>In the laboratory, the morphogenesis checkpoint can be induced by treating cells with inhibitors of actin polymerization (Latrunculin-A [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">McMillan et al., 1998</xref>]), by expressing mutations that interfere with actin polymerization (<italic>tpm1</italic>&#x00394; [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">McMillan et al., 1998</xref>]), or with bud formation in general (<italic>cdc24</italic>

</title><p>Although Swe1 is able to phosphorylate Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 and it is transcribed earlier than Clb2, the morphogenesis checkpoint is not operational during normal cell division. How does the model explain this apparent contradiction? <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows that, as soon as bud formation occurs, most of the active Swe1 is modified by Hsl1 into Swe1M and therefore inactivated. Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 rises rapidly and phosphorylates Swe1M, converting it into PSwe1M, which is rapidly degraded. The time course of total Swe1 (Swe1T) agrees with published data (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Sia et al., 1998</xref>). Concentration of the phosphorylated unmodified form (PSwe1) is negligible during a wild-type cell cycle, according to the model. A similar timing of Swe1 redistribution among its four forms occurs in <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394; (unpublished data), because Swe1 never gets a chance to phosphorylate Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2. On the other hand, in <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), Swe1 follows a completely different path in the Swe1 box (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Because the left part of the box is unavailable, Swe1 oscillates between its active form and its phosphorylated form. Total Swe1 undergoes small amplitude oscillations because Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 transiently inhibits its transcription factor, SBF, but it does not undergo large amplitude oscillations, as in wild type and <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394;, because Swe1 is never transformed into the highly unstable form (PSwe1M) in <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">McMillan et al., 1999a</xref>). Although this redistribution of Swe1 among its four possible forms is completely different from wild type and <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394;, the overall timing of cell division is not affected. Even though Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 is inhibited, it accumulates enough active form to switch on its transcription, to activate Mih1, and eventually to phosphorylate and inhibit Swe1.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>

In our model, Clb1 and Clb2 are lumped together as Clb2. Based on evidence in <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cross et al.

Hence, in <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; we reduce Clb transcription rate (<italic>k</italic>

Clb1 transcription is initially kept low, the cell is stuck in G2 and increases in size. However, an increasing amount of Clb1 accumulates in the nucleus as the cell becomes larger, and eventually it is able to transform Swe1 to its inactive phosphorylated form PSwe1, and to lead the cell through mitosis.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>

The molecular mechanism underlying this G2 delay relies on the antagonism between Swe1 and Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2. These two protein kinases inhibit each other, and engagement of the checkpoint depends on the outcome of their fight. During a normal cell cycle, Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 is able to overcome Swe1 activity, whereas when bud formation is impaired, Swe1 is stabilized and active, and the cell cycle is delayed in G2 phase. The morphogenesis checkpoint inhibits the activity of Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 in two different ways. First, because bud formation is impaired, Hsl1 cannot act to inhibit Swe1 and to label it for degradation. Moreover, if actin cannot polymerize, then a second inhibitory signal impinges on the cell cycle through a MAPK pathway, whose ultimate effect is to alter the ratio of activities of Mih1 and Swe1 (by inactivating Mih1, or possibly by activating Swe1). Reviewing the current literature, we have formulated a hypothesis (wiring diagram) of the way these genes and proteins interact.</p><p>The main objective of our analysis is to verify whether the proposed mechanism can reproduce in quantitative detail the relevant experimental data. Because intuition and qualitative arguments are inadequate to predict the behavior of the complex network controlling yeast cell cycle dynamics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and the morphogenesis checkpoint (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), we have tried to put this problem in a rigorous mathematical context.</p><sec><title>Model's assumptions</title><p>The molecular network controlling yeast cell cycle dynamics has been studied in detail (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2000</xref>), and the wiring diagram we use to describe it is simple but effective. On the other hand, the network we propose for the morphogenesis checkpoint is based on three assumptions that have not been experimentally verified: (1) Swe1 is inactivated when phosphorylated by Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2; (2) Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 and Mih1 activate each other (a positive feedback loop); and (3) Swe1 is inactivated by a posttranslational modification introduced (indirectly) by Hsl1.</p><p>Performing a parameter analysis to investigate the extent to which these assumptions can be relaxed, we discovered that the first and second are not necessary to explain the phenotypes of the checkpoint mutants we are studying. This result is somehow surprising because assumptions 1 and 2 are based on clear experimental evidence in <italic>X. laevis</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>. It is possible that these assumptions will be needed in the future, when more experiments characterizing the morphogenesis checkpoint must be taken into account. We decided to include them in the basal parameter set, because of analogies with other organisms and because these assumptions make the model more robust.</p><p>As for the third assumption, parameter analysis shows that it cannot be relaxed. In particular, D.J. Lew (personal communication) showed that <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; cells are larger than <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394; cells. This observation poses a strict constraint on the activity of Swe1M, the Hsl1-modified form. Were this constraint ignored, the other data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> would permit a larger activity for Swe1M. Nonetheless, even without this constraint some regulation of Swe1M activity is required, as other genotypes fail when Swe1M activity reaches 20% of Swe1 activity. Summarizing, our model predicts that Hsl1 indirectly inactivates Swe1 activity.</p><p>The size difference between <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394; plays a crucial role in constraining parameter values of the model. For the basal parameter set we propose, <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; cells are only 21% larger than <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394; cells. The size differential cannot be made much larger without bringing the model into contradiction with some other property of the mutant set. Most parameter changes away from the basal set reduce the size differential and quickly bring the model's prediction below our acceptance threshold (size ratio &#x0003e;1.15). Given the importance of this observation in constraining the model, we suggest that the size ratio of these two mutants be measured accurately.</p></sec><sec><title>Model's behavior</title><p>According to the model, Swe1 can be present in four different forms, and the way Swe1 is distributed among these forms depends on whether the checkpoint is invoked or not. In wild-type cells, the morphogenesis checkpoint is normally switched off because as soon as the bud is formed Hsl1 is activated and Swe1 is converted into the inactive form, Swe1M. If <italic>HSL1</italic> is deleted, the unmodified Swe1 is able to phosphorylate and inactivate Cdc28. In this case, dephosphorylation of Cdc28 (i.e., the presence of Mih1) becomes necessary. On the other hand, if <italic>MIH1</italic> is deleted, Swe1 can still be converted into the doubly modified form (PSwe1M) and degraded. This basic difference between <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; is particularly evident in the double mutants <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394;. These cells experience a G2 delay because they rely on Clb1 alone to enter mitosis. In <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; the delay lasts longer than in <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394;, because Swe1 cannot be converted into its modified inactive form Swe1M. Not surprisingly, when both <italic>HSL1</italic> and <italic>MIH1</italic> are deleted, the cell is blocked in G2.</p><p>These behaviors set the stage for understanding the morphogenesis checkpoint. A <italic>cdc24</italic>
<sup>ts</sup> cell has a similar, but milder, phenotype than a <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; cell, as we assume that the signal transduction pathway operating through Mpk1 does not completely inhibit Mih1. Therefore, the G2 block in <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; becomes a G2 delay in <italic>cdc24</italic>
<sup>ts</sup>. After a time the checkpoint-induced cell (<italic>cdc24</italic>
<sup>ts</sup>) undergoes adaptation, i.e., ND without bud formation. The selective advantages of this control loop are clear: becoming dinucleate is to be avoided, if possible, but it is better than death.</p></sec><sec><title>Bifurcation diagrams</title><p>The morphogenesis checkpoint acts like a &#x0201c;governor&#x0201d; to the cell cycle engine, slowing progression through the cell cycle when a particular danger signal (failure to bud) is perceived. To understand the relationship between the engine and its governor, it is useful to introduce the notion of a bifurcation diagram. In <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>, we plot Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 activity (the state of the engine) as a function of cell size (the motive force for cell cycle progression in yeast; see Bifurcation analysis, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200306139/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200306139/DC1</ext-link>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Tyson et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Under normal conditions (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> A), the Cdc28-control system has two characteristic states: a stable steady state (at small size) and a stable oscillatory state (at large size). A small newborn cell is attracted to the stable steady state of low Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 activity; kept low by active Cdh1 and Sic1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The cell is trapped in G1 because it is too small to warrant a new round of DNA replication and division. When the cell grows to a critical size (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> A, mass = 1), the stable steady state is lost, and the cell cycle engine begins an oscillation that drives Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 to larger activity. The cell replicates its DNA and enters mitosis. The mitotic state is intrinsically unstable, because high levels of Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 turn on Cdc20, which destroys Cdc28's cyclin partner. As Cdc28 activity drops, the cell divides and the control system is reset to the domain of the stable steady state. The duration of the budded phase (S-G2-M) is fixed at &#x0223c;60 min, the time it takes to complete one oscillation. The duration of G1 phase is variable, depending on growth rate and asymmetry of division.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>
<bold>Bifurcation diagrams for the cell cycle engine.</bold> We plot Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 activity, representative of the state of the cell cycle control system, against cell mass, <italic>M</italic>, which is the driving force for progression through the cell cycle. That is, for a fixed value of <italic>M</italic>, we solve the differential equations in Table S1 until the control system reaches a stable, self-maintaining state, which is either a steady state (no further change in activities of the regulatory proteins) or an oscillatory state (perfectly repeated fluctuations of their activities). Horizontal bars are placed at the Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 level characteristic of steady states, and vertical arrows represent the range of fluctuations of Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 activity in an oscillatory state. These diagrams are schematic cartoons; for accurately computed bifurcation diagrams, see online supplemental material (Bifurcation analysis) and Fig. S1. Notice the axes are scaled logarithmically. Because we assume cells grow exponentially, equal distances along the log(mass) axis represent equal intervals of time. Along the log(activity) axis we associate low activity with G1, intermediate activity with S-G2, and high activity with M phase. (A) Checkpoint silent. The bold dashed line is a cell-cycle trajectory: as the cell grows, the Cdc28 control system is attracted to the stable, self-maintaining state at its current cell mass. A small cell persists in the G1-state until that state disappears at <italic>M</italic> = 1. Thereafter, the cell executes an oscillation in Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 activity, passing through S, G2 and M phases. When Cdc28 activity falls, as the cell exits mitosis, the cell divides and the newborn progeny are attracted to the stable G1-state. (B) Checkpoint invoked. At the restrictive temperature, a <italic>cdc24<sup>ts</sup></italic> cell continues to grow but fails to make a bud. Consequently, Swe1 is stabilized, and a new self-maintaining steady state, with intermediate activity of Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2, is created. The cell arrests in S-G2 phase for about one mass-doubling time, until it grows to <italic>M</italic> = 2, where the G2-arrested state disappears. At this time, the cell adapts to the checkpoint signal, enters mitosis, and becomes dinucleate. Because the cell does not divide, it stays in the oscillatory regime and rereplicates its DNA after a very short G1 phase. The cell reenters mitosis and becomes tetranucleate. The time between NDs is the period of the underlying oscillatory state, &#x0223c;60 min in the model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="200306139f10"/></fig><p>When the morphogenesis checkpoint is invoked (no bud), active Swe1 creates a second stable steady state of the cell cycle engine at intermediate Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 activity (higher than the G1 steady state, lower than the peak of the oscillation; <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> B). Cdh1 and Sic1 are gone, Cdc28&#x02013;Cln activity is high, and Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 activity is depressed by Swe1-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylation. High activity of Cdc28&#x02013;Cln drives the cell into DNA synthesis, but low activity of Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 is insufficient for mitosis. Hence, the intermediate steady state corresponds to a cell stuck in G2. A newborn daughter cell will grow to mass = 1 and enter S phase, as usual. But then it arrests in G2 phase until it grows large enough to bypass the G2 arrest and enter mitosis. The delay will be 2&#x02013;3 h, depending on growth rate and critical mass at the end of the G2-arrested state. When the cell reaches this size (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> B, mass = 2), it adapts to the checkpoint, undergoes ND, and becomes dinucleate (the cell cannot divide because it never made a bud). At this point the model makes a noteworthy prediction. Because the engine is still in the oscillatory domain, it will pause only briefly in G1, then rereplicate its DNA and enter mitosis, becoming tetraploid (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Sia et al., 1996</xref>). To see the predicted shortening of G1 phase, this experiment is best done at slow growth rates, for which the duration of G1 phase is usually long.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary of the model's predictions and suggestions</title><p>The model makes two particularly clear and unexpected predictions. Regarding Hsl1 kinase, it is evidently involved in Swe1 degradation because Swe1 is stable in <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; (deletion) mutants and Swe1 is degraded more rapidly in <italic>HSL1</italic>
<sup>OP</sup> (overproduction) mutants (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">McMillan et al., 1999a</xref>). The effect is indirect, because Swe1 does not appear to be a substrate for Hsl1 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cid et al., 2001</xref>). Our model calculations show that, in order to account for known dynamical features of the checkpoint mutants in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>, Hsl1-dependent modification of Swe1 (whatever it may be) must also inhibit Swe1 kinase activity by at least 80%. To test this prediction will require reliable assays of Swe1 kinase activity, which are currently under development in Lew's laboratory (Lew, D.J., personal communication). Regarding adaptation, it is well known that <italic>cdc24<sup>ts</sup></italic> cells, which cannot bud at the restrictive temperature, will nonetheless, after several hours delay, proceed through mitosis and become dinucleate. The model predicts that these cells will rereplicate their DNA soon after ND. To readily observe the predicted shortening of G1 phase, cell growth should be restricted, so that unperturbed daughter cells have a long G1 period.</p><p>The model can be used to predict mutant phenotypes (such as the many blank spaces under the E columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Right or wrong, such predictions are handy in designing experiments and extremely valuable in interpreting the behavior of newly characterized mutants in the context of all previously studied mutants (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cross, 2003</xref>). In addition, the values assigned to most of the kinetic parameters in Table S2 are predictions. In our experience, similar predictions made on the cell cycle regulatory system of frog eggs proved to be remarkably accurate (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Marlovits et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The model also points to other experiments that would provide critical information for refining our understanding of the morphogenetic checkpoint. For instance, first, we would like to have precise measurements of the sizes of <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>hsl1</italic>&#x00394; cells, because these numbers would provide strict constraints on the parameters in the model. Second, we would like to know whether Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 and Mih1 are indeed involved in a positive feedback loop in budding yeast, or not. The mutant phenotypes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> are insufficient to resolve this issue. Third, the kinase activity of PSwe1 relative to Swe1 should be measured, to resolve the uncertainty about this ratio. Finally, for future modeling purposes, it would be nice to know whether the MAPK pathway acts by down-regulating Mih1 or up-regulating Swe1.</p></sec><sec><title>Morphogenesis checkpoint or size control?</title><p>
<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Harvey and Kellogg (2003)</xref> have recently challenged the notion of a &#x0201c;morphogenesis checkpoint,&#x0201d; claiming that Lew's data are rather a consequence of a size control checkpoint in G2 phase of the budding yeast cell cycle. Because <italic>swe1</italic>&#x00394; cells are slightly smaller than wild-type cells, they propose that wild-type budding yeast cells, like fission yeast, have a size requirement for passing from G2 into M phase, as well as a size requirement for Start (G1-S transition). <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Harvey and Kellogg (2003)</xref> suggest that the G2 size requirement can be met only by bud growth (not by continued expansion of the mother cell). Hence, when bud formation or growth is blocked (by the <italic>cdc24</italic>
<sup>ts</sup> mutation or by Latrunculin-A treatment, respectively), the cell finds it difficult or impossible to meet the G2 size requirement, and so mitosis is delayed or blocked completely. In this view, there is no such thing as a morphogenesis checkpoint particular to budding yeast cells; the phenomenon is just a consequence of a minimum size for the G2-M transition and growth problems in cells that lack buds.</p><p>In Lew's view and in our model (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> A), the primary size requirement for wild-type cells is at Start (the G1-S transition). After passing Start, cells normally pass through S into M (without stopping in G2) and back to G1. A G2-M size requirement manifests itself only when bud formation is blocked (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> B).</p><p>The fundamental difference between these two views is whether bud failures impair progress toward a minimum bud size for the G2-M transition (Kellogg's view) or create a large threshold for entering into M phase (Lew's view). Both views can explain equally well the observation that actin disruption (by treatment with Latrunculin-A) delays mitotic entry indefinitely. The two views give very different accounts of cell cycle mutants. In Lew's picture, when a bud fails to form, a surveillance mechanism, involving Hsl1 and Mpk1, creates a stable G2-arrested steady state (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> B), by activating Swe1 and inhibiting Mih1. The <italic>cdc24</italic>
<sup>ts</sup> cell continues to grow at the restrictive temperature, but it must now satisfy a large size requirement for passing from G2 into M phase. After a characteristic delay, the cell enters M phase and becomes dinucleate.</p><p>In Kellogg's picture, it is difficult to explain why <italic>cdc24</italic>
<sup>ts</sup> cells, which fail to make a bud at all, are only delayed in entering mitosis. Why is not mitosis delayed indefinitely, as in Latrunculin-treated cells? In this case, some fraction of mother cell growth must count toward meeting the G2-M transition size. Kellogg's view also cannot explain why <italic>mih1</italic>&#x00394; causes strikingly different effects in <italic>CDC24</italic> and <italic>cdc24</italic>
<sup>ts</sup> backgrounds (no delay in cell cycle progression and cell cycle block, respectively).</p><p>As we have shown by mathematical modeling, the concept of a morphogenesis checkpoint (with the assumption that Hsl1 down-regulates Swe1 activity) is compatible with most of the observed phenotypes of <italic>cdc24</italic>
<sup>ts</sup> cells. Just like checkpoints for damaged or unreplicated DNA or for spindle defects, the morphogenesis checkpoint responds to a signal (bud failure) by arresting the cell cycle engine in a stable steady state. The arrest can be bypassed if the cell grows large enough, which is a common feature of other checkpoint mechanisms (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Toczyski et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Simulations</title><p>The differential equations (Table S1) were solved numerically using XPP, which is software developed by Bard Ermentrout and freely downloadable from his FTP site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html">http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html</ext-link>).
