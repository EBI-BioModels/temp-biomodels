  <p>Another model from      <i>Hormone induced Calcium Oscillations in Liver Cells Can Be Explained by a Simply One Pool Model.</i>
          Anatomy of a single Ca2+ spike. Figure4A has been simulated by COPASI4.0.20(development). However, the simulated figure is slightly different from the paper, single spike of Ca2+ is around &quot;6&quot; time arbitrary units instead &quot;9&quot; time arbitrary units displayed in the paper.      </p>
