  &lt;div class="dc:title"&gt;Proctor2007 - Age related decline of proteolysis, ubiquitin-proteome system&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="dc:description"&gt;
    &lt;p style="font-size: 12px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: helvetica, &amp;apos;trebuchet MS&amp;apos;, arial, sans-serif;"&gt;This
  is a stochastic model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system for a
  generic pool of native proteins (NatP), which have a half-life of
  about 10 hours under normal conditions. It is assumed that these
  proteins are only degraded after they have lost their native
  structure due to a damage event. This is represented in the model
  by the misfolding reaction which depends on the level of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) in the cell. Misfolded proteins (MisP) are
  first bound by an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitin (Ub) is
  activated by E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) and then passed to
  E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme). The E2 enzyme then passes the
  ubiquitin molecule to the E3/MisP complex with the net effect
  that the misfolded protein is monoubiquitinated and both E2 and
  E3 are released. Further ubiquitin molecules are added in a
  step-wise manner. When the chain of ubiquitin molecules is of
  length 4 or more, the polyubiquitinated misfolded protein may
  bind to the proteasome. The model also includes de-ubiquitinating
  enzymes (DUB) which cleave ubiquitin molecules from the chain in
  a step-wise manner. They work on chains attached to misfolded
  proteins both unbound and bound to the proteasomes. Misfolded
  proteins bound to the proteasome may be degraded releasing
  ubiquitin. Misfolded proteins including ubiquitinated proteins
  may also aggregate. Aggregates (AggP) may be sequestered
  (Seq_AggP) which takes them out of harm&amp;apos;s way or they may bind to
  the proteasome (AggP_Proteasome). Proteasomes bound by aggregates
  are no longer available for protein degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="bibo:abstract"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND: The ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible
    for homeostatic degradation of intact protein substrates as
    well as the elimination of damaged or misfolded proteins that
    might otherwise aggregate. During ageing there is a decline in
    proteasome activity and an increase in aggregated proteins.
    Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the
    presence of distinctive ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in
    affected regions of the brain. These inclusions consist of
    insoluble, unfolded, ubiquitinated polypeptides that fail to be
    targeted and degraded by the proteasome. We are using a systems
    biology approach to try and determine the primary event in the
    decline in proteolytic capacity with age and whether there is
    in fact a vicious cycle of inhibition, with accumulating
    aggregates further inhibiting proteolysis, prompting
    accumulation of aggregates and so on. A stochastic model of the
    ubiquitin-proteasome system has been developed using the
    Systems Biology Mark-up Language (SBML). Simulations are
    carried out on the BASIS (Biology of Ageing e-Science
    Integration and Simulation) system and the model output is
    compared to experimental data wherein levels of ubiquitin and
    ubiquitinated substrates are monitored in cultured cells under
    various conditions. The model can be used to predict the
    effects of different experimental procedures such as inhibition
    of the proteasome or shutting down the enzyme cascade
    responsible for ubiquitin conjugation. RESULTS: The model
    output shows good agreement with experimental data under a
    number of different conditions. However, our model predicts
    that monomeric ubiquitin pools are always depleted under
    conditions of proteasome inhibition, whereas experimental data
    show that monomeric pools were depleted in IMR-90 cells but not
    in ts20 cells, suggesting that cell lines vary in their ability
    to replenish ubiquitin pools and there is the need to
    incorporate ubiquitin turnover into the model. Sensitivity
    analysis of the model revealed which parameters have an
    important effect on protein turnover and aggregation kinetics.
    CONCLUSION: We have developed a model of the
    ubiquitin-proteasome system using an iterative approach of
    model building and validation against experimental data. Using
    SBML to encode the model ensures that it can be easily modified
    and extended as more data become available. Important aspects
    to be included in subsequent models are details of ubiquitin
    turnover, models of autophagy, the inclusion of a pool of
    short-lived proteins and further details of the aggregation
    process.&lt;/p&gt;
