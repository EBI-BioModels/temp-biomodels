  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
Pancreatic beta-cells exhibit bursting oscillations with a wide range of
periods. Whereas periods in isolated cells are generally either a few seconds or
a few minutes, in intact islets of Langerhans they are intermediate (10-60 s).
We develop a mathematical model for beta-cell electrical activity capable of
generating this wide range of bursting oscillations. Unlike previous models,
bursting is driven by the interaction of two slow processes, one with a
relatively small time constant (1-5 s) and the other with a much larger time
constant (1-2 min). Bursting on the intermediate time scale is generated without
need for a slow process having an intermediate time constant, hence phantom
bursting. The model suggests that isolated cells exhibiting a fast pattern may
nonetheless possess slower processes that can be brought out by injecting
suitable exogenous currents. Guided by this, we devise an experimental protocol
using the dynamic clamp technique that reliably elicits islet-like, medium
period oscillations from isolated cells. Finally, we show that strong electrical
coupling between a fast burster and a slow burster can produce synchronized
medium bursting, suggesting that islets may be composed of cells that are
intrinsically either fast or slow, with few or none that are intrinsically
medium.
