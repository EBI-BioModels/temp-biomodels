  <p>The mycobacterial cell wall is a distinctive thick layer that protects the tubercle bacillus from general antibiotics and the host’s immune system. Mycolic acids, which are long-chain α-alkyl-β-hydroxy fatty acids, are the major constituents of this protective layer, and their synthesis has been shown to be critical for the survival of M. tuberculosis. This model captures the mycolic acid pathway in M. tuberculosis with 197 metabolites participating in 219 reactions catalysed by 28 proteins. The model helps in rational identification of potential anti-tubercular drug targets.</p>
