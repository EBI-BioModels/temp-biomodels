% This file works with MATLAB and is automatically generated with 
% the System Biology Format Converter (http://sbfc.sourceforge.net/)
% from an SBML file. 
% To run this file with Octave you must edit the comments providing
% the definition of the ode solver and the signature for the 
% xdot function.
%
% The conversion system has the following limitations:
%  - You may have to re order some reactions and Assignment Rules definition
%  - Delays are not taken into account
%  - You should change the lsode parameters (start, end, steps) to get better results
