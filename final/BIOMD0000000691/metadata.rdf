    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>On the basis of a detailed model of yeast glycolysis, the
    effect of intercellular dynamics is analysed theoretically. The
    model includes the main steps of anaerobic glycolysis, and the
    production of ethanol and glycerol. Transmembrane diffusion of
    acetaldehyde is included, since it has been hypothesized that
    this substance mediates the interaction. Depending on the
    kinetic parameter, the single-cell model shows both stationary
    and oscillatory behaviour. This agrees with experimental data
    with respect to metabolite concentrations and phase shifts. The
    inclusion of intercellular coupling leads to a variety of
    dynamical modes, such as synchronous oscillations, and
    different kinds of asynchronous behavior. These oscillations
    can co-exist, leading to bi- and tri-rhythmicity. The
    corresponding parameter regions have been identified by a
    bifurcation analysis. The oscillatory dynamics of synchronized
    cell populations are investigated by calculating the phase
    responses to acetaldehyde pulses. Simulations are performed
    with respect to the synchronization of two subpopulations that
    are oscillating out of phase before mixing. The effect of the
    various process on synchronization is characterized
    quantitatively. While continuous exchange of acetaldehyde might
    synchronize the oscillations for appropriate sets of parameter
    values, the calculated synchronization time is longer than that
    observed experimentally. It is concluded either that addition
    to the transmembrane exchange of acetaldehyde, other processes
    may contribute to intercellular coupling, or that intracellular
    regulator feedback plays a role in the acceleration of the
    synchronization. for appropriate sets of parameter values, the
    calculated synchronization time is longer than that observed
