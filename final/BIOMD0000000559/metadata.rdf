    &lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="bibo:abstract"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND: Alpha-synuclein (ASYN) is central in Parkinson&amp;apos;s
    disease (PD) pathogenesis. Converging pieces of evidence
    suggest that the levels of ASYN expression play a critical role
    in both familial and sporadic Parkinson&amp;apos;s disease. ASYN fibrils
    are the main component of inclusions called Lewy Bodies (LBs)
    which are found mainly in the surviving neurons of the
    substantia nigra. Despite the accumulated knowledge regarding
    the involvement of ASYN in molecular mechanisms underlying the
    development of PD, there is much information missing which
    prevents understanding the causes of the disease and how to
    stop its progression. RESULTS: Using a Systems Biology
    approach, we develop a biomolecular reactions model that
    describes the intracellular ASYN dynamics in relation to
    overexpression, post-translational modification,
    oligomerization and degradation of the protein. Especially for
    the proteolysis of ASYN, the model takes into account the
    biological knowledge regarding the contribution of Chaperone
    Mediated Autophagy (CMA), macro-autophagic and proteasome
    pathways in the protein&amp;apos;s degradation. Importantly, inhibitory
    phenomena, caused by ASYN, concerning CMA (more specifically
    the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2a, abbreviated as
    Lamp2a receptor, which is the rate limiting step of CMA) and
    the proteasome are carefully modeled. The model is validated by
    simulation studies of known experimental overexpression data
    from SH-SY5Y cells and the unknown model parameters are
    estimated either computationally or by experimental fitting.
    The calibrated model is then tested under three hypothetical
    intervention scenarios and in all cases predicts increased cell
    viability that agrees with experimental evidence. The biomodel
    has been annotated and is made available in SBML format.
    CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical model presented here successfully
    simulates the dynamic phenomena of ASYN overexpression and
    oligomerization and predicts the biological system&amp;apos;s behavior
    in a number of scenarios not used for model calibration. It
    allows, for the first time, to qualitatively estimate the
    protein levels that are capable of deregulating proteolytic
    homeostasis. In addition, it can help form new hypotheses for
    intervention that could be tested experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class="dc:description"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: The model contains reactions of species located in different compartments. If the model is applied using volume sizes unequal to one, an extension of the model might be reasonable to guarantee mass conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
