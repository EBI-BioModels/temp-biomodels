To gain insight into this phenomenon, we have analyzed responses of a lab strain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to antibiotics that target the ribosome.

However, they are falling victim to their own success due to decades of overuse and misuse. Bacteria have developed resistance to all existing antibiotics and they are doing so at an alarming rate, considering the slow timescale at which new antibiotics are being developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Falconer and Brown, 2009</xref>). In addition to developing new antibiotics, there is a critical need to design better treatment protocols by using existing antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Levy and Marshall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Yeh et al, 2009</xref>). A major challenge facing the development of effective antibiotic treatment is the lack of understanding of how bacterial populations respond to treatment. As such, a better understanding of the myriad of ways in which bacteria can resist or tolerate antibiotic treatment at the population level is required.</p><p>The efficacy of many antibiotics is known to decline with increasing inoculum of bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brook, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Soriano et al, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Udekwu et al, 2009</xref>). At intermediate concentrations of these antibiotics, a bacterial population can survive if its initial density is high, but can go extinct otherwise. Known as the inoculum effect (IE), this phenomenon has been observed for a wide range of antibiotic classes including &#x003b2;-lactams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Fass, 1983</xref>), glycopeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">McGrath et al, 1994</xref>), aminoglycosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kelly and Matsen, 1976</xref>), macrolides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Carbon, 1998</xref>), quinolones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Fass, 1983</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Chin et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Cotroneo et al, 2008</xref>). In the clinical setting, the presence of IE is undesirable as it can cause overestimation of <italic>in vitro</italic> resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Duraisingh et al, 1999</xref>), increased mortality rates of infected hosts due to administration of insufficient doses of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Soriano et al, 1990</xref>), and increases in the generation rate of resistant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Martinez and Baquero, 2000</xref>). IE has been observed both in animal models of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Nicas and Bryan, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Mizunaga et al, 2005</xref>) and in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Moshkowitz et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Lai et al, 2003</xref>), suggesting its clinical relevance. To date, however, there is a general lack of mechanistic understanding of IE.</p><p>For a bacterial pathogen that can break down an antibiotic, the cause of IE appears to be self-evident: increasing bacterial density would increase the overall turnover rate of the antibiotic, thus reducing its efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Soriano et al, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Craig et al, 2004</xref>). It is particularly puzzling, however, how IE would arise when antibiotics are not broken down by pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Udekwu et al, 2009</xref>). This scenario encompasses a large number of antibiotics that target the ribosome. IE also resembles growth bistability: for the same concentration of an antibiotic, the survival or extinction of a population depends on its initial condition&#x02014;its initial density. In this case, since extracellular factors are unlikely the underlying causes of IE, it is plausible that the growth bistability could arise from interactions between antibiotics and intracellular factors. Furthermore, we could focus on system dynamics involving both antibiotics and ribosomes, which are the primary intracellular targets of these antibiotics. Taken these together, we ask whether IE can be explained by non-linear dynamics resulting from the antibiotic-mediated inhibition of the ribosome.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Antibiotic inhibition can lead to growth bistability</title><p>We first considered the dynamics of an antibiotic that specifically targets and interacts with the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). In each bacterium, the accumulation of the ribosome (<italic>C</italic>) can be described as a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Tadmor and Tlusty, 2008</xref>). The antibiotic (<italic>A</italic>) can prevent the activation of the positive feedback by binding to <italic>C</italic>, resulting in a basic regulatory motif able to generate bistability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Thron, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). For certain antibiotics, inhibition of <italic>C</italic> induces the heat-shock response (HSR) due to mistranslated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Goff and Goldberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Vanbogelen and Neidhardt, 1990</xref>). HSR in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> upregulates chaperone proteins (e.g., DnaK) and proteases (lon and ClpP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Goff et al, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Parsell and Lindquist, 1993</xref>). These proteases can target ribosomal proteins for increased degradation when bacteria are stressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kuroda et al, 2001</xref>). Heat shock, as well as treatment with certain antibiotics, has also been shown to cause degradation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dubin, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Suzuki and Kilgore, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Rosenthal and Iandolo, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Tolker-Nielsen and Molin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Sykes et al, 2010</xref>) and ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Sykes et al, 2010</xref>). Therefore, degradation of <italic>C</italic> (ribosomes) can be increased when these antibiotics stimulate HSR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>). The above interactions can be captured by a simple mathematical model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1">Equation 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Equation S13</xref>):</p><p><disp-formula id="eq1"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d32e480" xlink:href="msb201249-m1.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>c</italic> represents the concentration of ribosomes <italic>C</italic>, &#x003b1; represents the basal synthesis rate of <italic>c</italic>, &#x003ba; represents the concentration of <italic>c</italic> eliciting half-maximal activation of its positive feedback, &#x003c6; represents the applied antibiotic concentration, &#x003b3; represents the bacterial density, and &#x003b4; lumps the effects of multiple reactions: it increases with decreasing rates of intrinsic or antibiotic-induced degradation of <italic>C</italic>, increasing dissociation between the antibiotic and <italic>C</italic>, and increasing export rate of the antibiotic. We considered &#x003b4; to represent antibiotic-induced degradation of <italic>C</italic> because dissociation constants of some antibiotics with ribosomes are of similar magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Long and Porse, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Balenci et al, 2008</xref>), but only certain antibiotics lead to HSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Vanbogelen and Neidhardt, 1990</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1">Equation 1</xref> was developed by simplifying five equations that describe the synthesis of ribosomes, the transport of an antibiotic across bacterial membranes, the binding between the antibiotic and ribosomes, the targeting of ribosomes for degradation, and the release of the antibiotic from ribosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Equations S1&#x02013;S5</xref>). We further assumed that certain molecular species are in quasi steady states due to their fast kinetics and that total amount of the antibiotic is conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Equations S6&#x02013;S12</xref>). This way, we obtained a simplified equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1">Equation 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Equation S13</xref>) that would facilitate our mathematical analysis. The first term on the right hand side (RHS) of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1">Equation 1</xref> represents the leaky synthesis rate of ribosomes. The second RHS term models the positive feedback loop by <italic>C</italic>. The third RHS term represents both the degradation and antibiotic inhibition of <italic>C</italic>. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref> for detailed model description. We note that in response to certain antibiotics, <italic>E. coli</italic> can upregulate the transcriptional rate of ribosomal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fraenkel and Neidhardt, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kurland and Maaloe, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bollenbach et al, 2009</xref>). Inclusion of this upregulation (&#x0003c;2-fold; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bollenbach et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kurland and Maaloe, 1962</xref>) would not affect our qualitative prediction of IE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Equations S17&#x02013;S19</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B and C</xref> shows qualitatively different solutions of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1">Equation 1</xref> using two parameter sets. In each case, the black line corresponds to the first two RHS terms of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1">Equation 1</xref> (the synthesis of <italic>C</italic>); the dotted line corresponds to the third RHS term (the degradation of <italic>C</italic>). If &#x003b4; is sufficiently large (e.g., due to slow degradation of <italic>C</italic>), then the system has a globally stable steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). In this case, <italic>c</italic> will converge to the steady state regardless of the initial condition of the system. However, if &#x003b4; is sufficiently small (e.g., due to fast degradation of <italic>C</italic>), then the system has two stable steady states that are separated by an unstable one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Bacteria would survive if and only if <italic>c</italic> reaches the high steady state.</p><p>Next, we calculated steady-state values (<italic>c</italic><sub>ss</sub>) at two different initial densities (&#x003b3;) and increasing antibiotic concentrations (&#x003c6;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). If &#x003b4; is sufficiently large (e.g., due to slow degradation of <italic>C</italic>), then <italic>c</italic> would be insensitive to &#x003b3; (red and green dotted lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). In this scenario, bacterial populations either survive or go extinct irrespective of their initial density. This case could arise for an antibiotic that does not enhance degradation of ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>, gray box). However, if &#x003b4; is sufficiently small (e.g., due to the fast degradation of <italic>C</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>, gray box), then <italic>c</italic> would be sensitive to &#x003b3;. At &#x003c6; &#x0223c;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>, <italic>c</italic> would converge to a high stable steady state if the initial density is high (&#x003b3;=10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>, green line). At the high initial density, each bacterium could receive a small concentration of an antibiotic, which would only minimally induce ribosomal degradation and allow the rise of ribosomal concentration. Otherwise, with a low initial density (&#x003b3;=10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>, red line), <italic>c</italic> would converge to a low stable steady state. At the low initial density, each bacterium would receive a high concentration of an antibiotic, which would activate ribosomal degradation and prevent the accumulation of ribosomes. Therefore, the bistability would cause either population survival (i.e., increase in <italic>C</italic>, which has been noted previously; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Scott et al, 2010</xref>) or extinction (i.e., decrease in <italic>C</italic>) depending on the initial population density. This bistable region represents the IE region, where the ability of a population to survive antibiotic treatment depends upon its initial density. We note that the bistability requires strong inhibition of <italic>C</italic> by <italic>A</italic>, which can be generated through antibiotic-induced degradation of <italic>C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>, basic motif). When this occurs, antibiotics are titrated more strongly through the degradation pathway, which gives rise to IE. Furthermore, the region of IE would shift to higher values of &#x003c6; with increasing &#x003b4; and diminish at &#x003b4;&#x0003e;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). The magnitude of &#x003b4; depends on several parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>) including fast degradation of <italic>C</italic>, which could be enhanced by HSR.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Kanamycin, which induces HSR and fast degradation of ribosomes, led to IE</title><p>We first validated the fundamental assumption of our model that certain antibiotics could induce HSR and cause fast ribosomal degradation. To test this assumption, we analyzed the response of an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain to kanamycin and chloramphenicol. We chose these antibiotics because kanamycin, but not chloramphenicol, has been observed to induce HSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Vanbogelen and Neidhardt, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In addition, while several antibiotics have been shown to cause rRNA degradation, a previous study has shown that treatment with chloramphenicol does not cause rRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dubin, 1964</xref>). Consistent with the literature, we found that treatment with kanamycin, but not chloramphenicol, resulted in HSR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>) and led to enhanced degradation of a cyan fluorescence protein (CFP) fused to a ClpP targeting SsrA tag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). This enhanced degradation was likely due to increased ClpP activity resulting from induced HSR. Furthermore, we found that treatment with kanamycin led to faster degradation of ribosomal protein L13 (fused to a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)) when compared with chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). We note that this fusion protein is integrated into the ribosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>). In addition, we found that treatment with kanamycin caused faster rRNA degradation than treatment with chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1E&#x02013;G</xref>). Finally, we verified that the amount of ribosomes increased in a growing bacterial population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1H</xref>), which is consistent with our model prediction on bistable dynamics of <italic>C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B&#x02013;D</xref>). As such, treatment with kanamycin, but not chloramphenicol, led to HSR and ribosome degradation.</p><p>Altogether, based on our model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1">Equation 1</xref>) and the experimental data, we expected kanamycin to exhibit IE (&#x003b4;<sub>low</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>), but not chloramphenicol (&#x003b4;<sub>high</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). Indeed, bacteria exhibited IE when treated with kanamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2A and I</xref>). At 6&#x02013;10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin, populations with low initial densities (black lines) did not grow after 24&#x02009;h. However, those with high initial densities (red lines) grew. In contrast, bacteria did not exhibit IE when treated with chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2B, C, and J</xref>). At each concentration of chloramphenicol tested, bacterial populations either grew or did not grow regardless of their initial density. As such, kanamycin, which causes HSR and ribosome degradation, resulted in IE, whereas chloramphenicol, which does not cause HSR and ribosome degradation, did not.</p><p>To examine generality of IE in bacterial pathogens, we tested enterotoxigenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (ATCC 43886, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>) and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (ATCC 14028, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). These pathogens also exhibited IE when treated with kanamycin, but not with chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A&#x02013;D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3A&#x02013;D</xref>). In support of the notion that HSR underlies IE, treatment with kanamycin, but not with chloramphenicol, resulted in HSR in both of these pathogens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3E</xref>).</p><p>Next, we carried out experiments to test the contribution of alternative mechanisms to the generation of IE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Our results indicate that IE was not due to the emergence of spontaneous mutants, as single colonies isolated from 6 to 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml of kanamycin (IE region) during the growth phase did not have increased minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) compared with untreated, wild-type bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2D and E</xref>). Furthermore, IE was not due to cell-to-cell communication or secreted metabolites that could confer protection of cells against antibiotic treatment. In particular, we isolated spent media from bacteria inoculated at a high initial cell density (50 &#x000d7; initial dilution) that were grown in 0, 6, 8, 10 or 12&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin (IE region) for 6&#x02009;h. The isolated spent media did not support the growth of bacteria inoculated at a low initial cell density (500 &#x000d7; dilution of an overnight culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2F</xref>). In addition, literature data suggest that bacteria secrete both indole and H<sub>2</sub>S, which can rescue bacteria from antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lee et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Shatalin et al, 2011</xref>). These secreted molecules could contribute to cell-density dependence mechanisms that cause IE. However, we observed that both <italic>tnaA</italic> (cannot produce indole) and <italic>sseA</italic> (produces significantly less H<sub>2</sub>S) knockout strains produced IE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2G and H</xref>). Finally, persister cells that can tolerate antibiotics could emerge, hence plausibly explain the growth of bacteria in the IE region. However, this explanation would require the generation of persister cells at a very high rate, which is in contrast to our single-cell measurements and inconsistent with the literature data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Taken together, these results further confirmed the notion that the major determinant of IE was the fast degradation of <italic>C</italic>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Model-guided perturbations of IE</title><p>If fast degradation of <italic>C</italic> was the major determinant for the generation of IE, then we hypothesized that other antibiotics that induce HSR would also cause IE. To test this notion, we examined bacterial response to streptomycin, puromycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, neomycin, and nourseothricin, which induce HSR, as well as tetracycline, which does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Vanbogelen and Neidhardt, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). Similarly to kanamycin, these antibiotics also bind to <italic>C</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and therefore can be described by our generic model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1">Equation 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, the antibiotics that induced HSR caused IE, whereas tetracycline did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4A&#x02013;C</xref>).</p><p>Our bifurcation analysis suggested that, if an antibiotic caused IE, increasing the degradation rate of <italic>C</italic> would decrease &#x003b4; and shift the bifurcation region, thus IE, to a lower antibiotic concentration (lower &#x003c6;). To test this prediction, we incubated cultures supplemented with kanamycin at 42&#x000b0;C to enhance HSR, which would increase the activity of several proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Neidhardt et al, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lindquist, 1986</xref>). As predicted, IE occurred at lower concentrations of kanamycin (0.5&#x02013;1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4D</xref>). Furthermore, our model analysis suggested that direct induction of HSR would facilitate the generation of IE for an antibiotic that normally does not induce HSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). We note that to satisfy this model prediction, an antibiotic that does not exhibit IE would need to have similar magnitude of transport and binding kinetics as kanamycin and does not interfere with the induction of ribosome degradation. To test this prediction, we incubated cultures at 42&#x000b0;C in medium supplemented with chloramphenicol, which did not exhibit IE at 37&#x000b0;C. Indeed, with heat shock, IE emerged at 0.5&#x02013;1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4E</xref>). We also demonstrated that heat shock (both with and without chloramphenicol treatment) caused fast degradation of both the ribosomal fusion protein L13-YFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) and rRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1E</xref>). These results further supported the notion that antibiotic-mediated HSR is a major pathway that enhances ribosome degradation, which generates IE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Our model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1">Equation 1</xref>) predicted that slow degradation of <italic>C</italic> would increase &#x003b4; and shift the bifurcation region, thus IE, to higher antibiotic concentrations of antibiotics (higher &#x003c6;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). Indeed, IE occurred at higher concentrations of kanamycin (12&#x02013;15&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4F</xref>) in the presence of an inhibitor (10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml) that specifically blocks the activity of serine proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bota and Davies, 2002</xref>). We note that treatment with a serine protease inhibitor reduced degradation of CFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4G</xref>). We also challenged bacteria using either a cysteine (10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml) or an aspartyl protease inhibitor (10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml), which shifted IE to slightly higher antibiotic concentrations (8&#x02013;12&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). This differential impact reflects the fact that serine, but not cysteine or aspartyl, proteases are typically upregulated during HSR. We further tested if the protease inhibitors could reverse the impact of heat-shock treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). Specifically, we added all protease inhibitors (20&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml) to bacteria treated with either kanamycin or chloramphenicol, coupled with heat shock at 42&#x000b0;C. We observed that the protease inhibitors shifted the IE region back toward higher concentrations of kanamycin (5&#x02013;6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml). Furthermore, the protease inhibitors abolished the IE generated by the combined treatment of chloramphenicol and heat shock.</p><p>To corroborate these results, we tested BW25113 strains that contain either a <italic>lon</italic> or <italic>clpX</italic> knockout. As the knockout strains carry a kanamycin resistance gene, we challenged them with streptomycin that also induced IE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Wild-type populations exhibited IE between 4 and 8&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4H</xref>).

With the <italic>clpX</italic> knockout, the IE region was also shrunk to 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4J</xref>). These results are consistent with our model predictions. We note that activation of chaperones by HSR would not affect our conclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Recovery kinetics from transient antibiotic treatment</title><p>Based on our proposed mechanism for IE, we would expect a profound difference in the recovery of bacterial populations after transient treatment by the two types of antibiotics. Indeed, our modeling analysis showed that fast degradation of <italic>C</italic> would considerably delay the recovery of bacterial populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). With a faster degradation of <italic>C</italic>, the total concentration of <italic>C</italic> would drop drastically during antibiotic treatment. As such, after the removal of an antibiotic, bacteria would need a longer time to synthesize sufficient amount of <italic>C</italic> to re-initiate growth.</p><p>To test this prediction, we examined recovery kinetics using a flow system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5A and B</xref>). Specifically, we incubated bacteria using medium supplemented with either 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin (that caused IE) or 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml chloramphenicol (that did not cause IE). After treatment for a specific duration, we washed bacteria using fresh medium and tracked population growth. We quantified recovery time as the time required for a population to increase above its initial density after antibiotic treatment. Consistent with the model prediction, we observed that the recovery time increased sharply with increasing duration of kanamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>, filled squares; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5C</xref>). After 4&#x02009;h of kanamycin treatment, bacterial populations did not recover within our experimental duration (&#x0003e;16&#x02009;h). For kanamycin treatment, the non-recovery of bacteria is likely due to death via hydroxyl radical damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kohanski et al, 2007</xref>) and detrimental protease activities because inhibiting the degradation of <italic>C</italic> conferred protective functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, recovery time stayed nearly constant with the tested durations of chloramphenicol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>, open squares; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5D</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Frequency dependence of periodic antibiotic treatment</title><p>While IE is commonly observed, its clinical relevance is sometimes debated, especially if antibiotics are applied periodically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Craig et al, 2004</xref>). Periodic antibiotic treatment is often favored because prolonged application of high concentrations of antibiotics can be toxic to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Powell et al, 1983</xref>) and can cause a strong selection pressure that favors resistant bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Harbarth et al, 2000</xref>). The efficacy of periodic treatment would depend on both the frequency and dose of the antibiotic. These parameters are typically determined empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Powell et al, 1983</xref>) without considering IE. To address the issue, recent computational studies have shown that IE can diminish the efficacy of periodic antibiotic treatment at a fixed treatment frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Udekwu et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Levin and Udekwu, 2010</xref>). However, these studies did not consider the molecular mechanism underlying IE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), which, as we have shown, can drastically modulate the recovery kinetics after a pulse of antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). By taking these factors into account, here we ask if the efficacy of periodic treatment would exhibit different dependence on the frequency of the treatment, which is a critical parameter in the clinical setting.</p><p>To address this question, we constructed a population-based simple model that incorporates two essential features of our experimental observations: IE and its impact on recovery time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). Without IE, bacterial populations grow at rate &#x003bc;<sub>2</sub> after a lag time &#x003c4;<sub>lag</sub> without an antibiotic and do not grow with the antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, case i). Based on experimental measurements, we assumed that &#x003c4;<sub>lag</sub> increases exponentially with the duration of an antibiotic that exhibits IE and stays constant otherwise (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6A</xref>). With IE and <italic>N</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> (which is a function of antibiotic concentration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), bacterial populations grow in the same way as the case above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, case ii). With IE and <italic>N</italic>&#x0003e;<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, bacterial populations grow at rate &#x003bc;<sub>2</sub> without the antibiotic and at rate &#x003bc;<sub>1</sub> with the antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, case iii). We note that this model assumed that bacteria would not grow when antibiotic concentration is above a certain threshold and would recover with a time delay when antibiotic concentration decreases below a certain threshold. As such, the inclusion of antibiotic decay dynamics could reduce the effective time that an antibiotic inhibits bacterial growth.</p><p>We then simulated bacterial growth in response to periodic pulses of an antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). For each pulse, duration of antibiotic treatment is half of the pulse period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). To ensure a fair comparison between pulse periods, the total time of bacterial exposure to each antibiotic was kept constant by using appropriate pulse periods (T) and observation time points. Without IE, bacteria would exhibit low-pass response: the population density would increase monotonically with increasing pulse periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>, top panel). This can be intuitively explained by the approximately constant &#x003c4;<sub>lag</sub> after transient treatment by such an antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). With a longer pulse period, the effective growth duration (<italic>T</italic>/2&#x02013;&#x003c4;<sub>lag</sub>) is greater and allows more bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the presence of IE and the delayed recovery kinetic could lead to band-pass bacterial response, where the population density would peak at an intermediate pulse period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>, bottom panel, period=100&#x02009;min). This can be explained by the exponential increase of &#x003c4;<sub>lag</sub> with increasing treatment duration in the presence of IE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). When the pulse period is small, its increase (thus a proportional increase in the treatment duration) causes a slower increase in &#x003c4;<sub>lag</sub>, which is at its initial stage of an exponential curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). In each period, the growth duration (<italic>T</italic>/2&#x02212;&#x003c4;<sub>lag</sub>) would increase with <italic>T</italic>. At an intermediate <italic>T</italic>, bacteria would have adequate time to recover from antibiotic treatment. This allows the population to grow beyond a threshold density for which subsequent antibiotic pulses are less effective at inhibiting bacterial growth. For sufficiently large <italic>T</italic>, &#x003c4;<sub>lag</sub> would increase much faster than <italic>T</italic>, leading to a decrease in the growth duration for increasing <italic>T</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). Therefore, the delayed recovery kinetic is a critical requirement for the emergence of the band-pass response and IE would speed up the growth of bacteria in the band-pass region. The band-pass behavior would depend on several parameters, including the bacterial growth rate and &#x003c4;<sub>lag</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). For example, the region of band-pass response would disappear with a sufficiently large basal &#x003c4;<sub>lag</sub> due to a high antibiotic concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6B</xref>). In this case, &#x003c4;<sub>lag</sub> after each pulse of treatment would always be longer than the treatment duration, leaving insufficient time for bacteria to recover in the absence of antibiotic in each period of the treatment. The region of band-pass behavior stays constant with a decreased &#x003bc;<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6B</xref>) because the slower &#x003bc;<sub>1</sub> would not change the steady-state dynamics, though the underlying temporal dynamics would vary for different parameters. We note that the inclusion of an antibiotic decay function did not qualitatively affect our model predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6C and D</xref>).</p><p>To test model predictions, we tracked bacterial growth in response to periodic antibiotic treatment using the flow system. Consistent with our batch-culture experiments, bacterial cultures initiated from low density did not grow when treated with a constant, high concentration of either chloramphenicol or kanamycin (10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A&#x02013;C</xref>). When challenged with 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml chloramphenicol, bacterial densities increased with increasing pulse periods of 40, 120, 240, and 480&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). In contrast, when challenged with pulses of either 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin or 80&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml puromycin (a concentration that caused IE), bacterial densities peaked at an intermediate period of 120&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figures 7A and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7C</xref>). When challenged with 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin (a concentration that did not cause IE), bacteria did not grow at all pulse periods examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7A</xref>), likely because bacteria recovered much slower from the treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6B</xref>, basal &#x003c4;<sub>lag</sub>=30). When we treated cells with chloramphenicol (10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml) and heat shock (42&#x000b0;C), bacterial density peaked at intermediate pulse period (120&#x02009;min, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7D</xref>). As such, exogenously applied heat shock coupled with chloramphenicol treatment was able to generate both IE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4E</xref>) and band-pass behavior. For treatment with both antibiotics, we note that the lower densities at the pulse period of 40&#x02009;min were not due to the loss of bacteria from the cell chamber (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7B</xref>). Our results demonstrate the drastic qualitative changes in treatment efficacy due to both IE and the recovery kinetics, which are critical factors that have been neglected in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Udekwu et al, 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on quantitative modeling and experimentation of bacterial growth challenged by antibiotics that inhibit ribosomes, we have established a new mechanism that underlies the generation of IE. This mechanism contributes to the understanding of the growing number of non-genetic tolerance mechanisms of bacteria, which include persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Lewis, 2007</xref>), population level communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Yarwood and Schlievert, 2003</xref>), and programmed bacterial death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bayles, 2007</xref>). We note that this mechanism fundamentally differs from a previously proposed mechanism for IE whereby bacteria secrete enzymes to degrade or modify antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Craig et al, 2004</xref>), in terms of both the molecular interactions involved and its consequences on bacterial population dynamics. Specifically, the mechanism requires the inhibition of a positive feedback loop by an inhibitor (the antibiotic) and the fast degradation of ribosomes induced by antibiotics that elicit HSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Such generic requirements suggest that this mechanism is likely applicable for treatment of other bacterial species by antibiotics that target ribosomes. Indeed, our experimental results on enterotoxigenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (ETEC) and <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> support this notion. Furthermore, the mechanism may also be applicable to antibiotics that target other components of the core replication machinery (e.g., RNA polymerases, DNA polymerases, and gyrase). These potential follow-up studies would likely require modification of our model because our model cannot capture the essential aspects of antibiotic inhibition for targets outside of the ribosomes (i.e., &#x003b2;-lactams, quinolones, etc.). By constraining the objective of this manuscript to ribosome-targeting antibiotics, we were able to model the interactions specifically and predicted results of perturbation.</p><p>Our model-guided perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) and experimental analyses have ruled out previously described mechanisms of antibiotic resistance that could account for IE including enzyme or metabolite secretion, mutation-based resistance, quorum sensing, and differences in initial metabolic states. However, we note that the mechanism described herein may also be activated along with other previously described responses to antibiotics, such as the production of radical oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kohanski et al, 2007</xref>). It is plausible that radical oxygen species may act as a trigger for activation of heat shock or increased activity of proteases. As such, we contend that the generation of HSR is a sufficient, but may not be the only, condition to enhance ribosomal degradation.</p><p>It is interesting to contemplate whether the fast degradation of ribosomes due to antibiotics could be generalized to bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotics. As is the case here, antibiotics that caused HSR and IE are bactericidal in <italic>E. coli</italic>, while those that did not cause IE are bacteriostatic and do not cause HSR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Our results suggest that ribosome degradation likely occurs before bacterial death because the inhibition of proteases shifted the IE region to higher antibiotic concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). As such, both ribosome degradation and bactericidal effect of the tested antibiotics are unlikely to be independent cellular events, alongside other cellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kohanski et al, 2007</xref>). Based on this reasoning, bacterial death cannot be distinguished as an alternative mechanism <italic>per se</italic>. However, we have demonstrated that a critical requirement of IE is the ability of an antibiotic to induce HSR, which leads to fast ribosome degradation.</p><p>Finally, we showed that IE could profoundly impact the efficacy of periodic antibiotic treatment. This may lead to prolonged periods of tolerance, which may lead to bacteria who acquire genetic mutations conferring antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lee et al, 2010</xref>). Despite the relative simplicity of our dosing regimen, our results highlight the potential of non-linear bacterial response to periodic treatment, which has not been previously observed. These results underscore the critical need to elucidate underlying mechanisms of IE, in order to achieve optimal treatment efficacy in the clinical setting.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 (B F- <italic>dcm ompT hsdS</italic>(<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub>&#x02212; <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub>&#x02212;) <italic>gal</italic>) was used throughout this study.
