  <div class="dc:description">
    <p>The efficacy of many antibiotics decreases with increasing bacterial density, a phenomenon called the ‘inoculum effect’ (IE). This study reveals that, for ribosome-targeting antibiotics, IE is due to bistable inhibition of bacterial growth, which reduces the efficacy of certain treatment frequencies.</p>

    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The inoculum effect (IE) refers to the decreasing efficacy of an antibiotic with increasing bacterial density. It represents a unique strategy of antibiotic tolerance and it can complicate design of effective antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections. To gain insight into this phenomenon, we have analyzed responses of a lab strain of Escherichia coli to antibiotics that target the ribosome. We show that the IE can be explained by bistable inhibition of bacterial growth. A critical requirement for this bistability is sufficiently fast degradation of ribosomes, which can result from antibiotic-induced heat-shock response. Furthermore, antibiotics that elicit the IE can lead to &apos;band-pass&apos; response of bacterial growth to periodic antibiotic treatment: the treatment efficacy drastically diminishes at intermediate frequencies of treatment. Our proposed mechanism for the IE may be generally applicable to other bacterial species treated with antibiotics targeting the ribosomes.</p>
