    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>In Alzheimer disease (AD), the intracerebral accumulation of
    amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is a critical yet poorly understood
    process. Aβ clearance via the blood-brain barrier is reduced by
    approximately 30% in AD patients, but the underlying mechanisms
    remain elusive. ABC transporters have been implicated in the
    regulation of Aβ levels in the brain. Using a mouse model of AD
    in which the animals were further genetically modified to lack
    specific ABC transporters, here we have shown that the
    transporter ABCC1 has an important role in cerebral Aβ
    clearance and accumulation. Deficiency of ABCC1 substantially
    increased cerebral Aβ levels without altering the expression of
    most enzymes that would favor the production of Aβ from the Aβ
    precursor protein. In contrast, activation of ABCC1 using
    thiethylperazine (a drug approved by the FDA to relieve nausea
    and vomiting) markedly reduced Aβ load in a mouse model of AD
    expressing ABCC1 but not in such mice lacking ABCC1. Thus, by
    altering the temporal aggregation profile of Aβ,
    pharmacological activation of ABC transporters could impede the
    neurodegenerative cascade that culminates in the dementia of
    AD.</p>
