    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Cell division is characterized by a sequence of events by
    which a cell gives rise to two daughter cells. Quantitative
    measurements of cell-cycle dynamics in single cells showed that
    despite variability in G1-, S-, and G2 phases, duration of
    mitosis is short and remarkably constant. Surprisingly, there
    is no correlation between cell-cycle length and mitotic
    duration, suggesting that mitosis is temporally insulated from
    variability in earlier cell-cycle phases. By combining live
    cell imaging and computational modeling, we showed that
    positive feedback is the molecular mechanism underlying the
    temporal insulation of mitosis. Perturbing positive feedback
    gave rise to a sluggish, variable entry and progression through
    mitosis and uncoupled duration of mitosis from variability in
    cell cycle length. We show that positive feedback is important
    to keep mitosis short, constant, and temporally insulated and
    anticipate it might be a commonly used regulatory strategy to
    create modularity in other biological systems.</p>
