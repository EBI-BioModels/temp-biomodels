Abstract

We investigate a mathematical model depicting the nonlinear dynamics of immunogenic tumors as envisioned by Kuznetsov et al. [1]. To understand the dynamics under what circumstances the cancer cells can be eliminated, we implement the theory of optimal control. We design two types of external treatment strategies, one is Adoptive Cellular Immunotherapy and another is interleukin-2. Our aim is to establish the treatment regimens that maximize the effector cell count and minimize the tumor cell burden and the deleterious effects of the total amount of drugs. We derive the existence of an optimal control by using the boundedness of solutions. We characterize the optimality system, in which the state system is coupled with co-states. The uniqueness of an optimal control of our problem is also analyzed. Finally, we demonstrate the numerical illustrations that the optimal regimens reduce the tumor burden under different scenarios.</pre>
