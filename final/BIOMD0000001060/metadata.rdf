  <p>The model describes the mechanisms by which macrophages differentiate into a given phenotype. The model shows that both extracellular and intracellular signalling are both important for that process. More specifically, STAT1 activity favors macrophages polarization towards M1 phenotype and STAT6 activity favors macrophage polarization towards M2 phenotype. However, these polarizations are can be reversed by molecular signalling.</p>
