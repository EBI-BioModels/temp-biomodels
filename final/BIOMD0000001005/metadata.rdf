  <p>The circadian rhythms influence the metabolic activity from molecular level to tissue, organ, and host level. Disruption of the circadian rhythms manifests to the host&apos;s health as metabolic syndromes, including obesity, diabetes, and elevated plasma glucose, eventually leading to cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the mechanism behind the relationship between circadian rhythms and metabolism. To start answering this question, we propose a semimechanistic mathematical model to study the effect of circadian disruption on hepatic gluconeogenesis in humans. Our model takes the light-dark cycle and feeding-fasting cycle as two environmental inputs that entrain the metabolic activity in the liver. The model was validated by comparison with data from mice and rat experimental studies. Formal sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were conducted to elaborate on the driving forces for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, simulating the impact of Clock gene knockout suggests that modification to the local pathways tied most closely to the feeding-fasting rhythms may be the most efficient way to restore the disrupted glucose metabolism in liver.</p>
