    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Amyloid-? (A?) is produced by the consecutive cleavage of
    amyloid precursor protein (APP) first by ?-secretase,
    generating C99, and then by ?-secretase. APP is also cleaved by
    ?-secretase. It is hypothesized that reducing the production of
    A? in the brain may slow the progression of Alzheimer disease.
    Therefore, different ?-secretase inhibitors have been developed
    to reduce A? production. Paradoxically, it has been shown that
    low to moderate inhibitor concentrations cause a rise in A?
    production in different cell lines, in different animal models,
    and also in humans. A mechanistic understanding of the A? rise
    remains elusive. Here, a minimal mathematical model has been
    developed that quantitatively describes the A? dynamics in cell
    lines that exhibit the rise as well as in cell lines that do
    not. The model includes steps of APP processing through both
    the so-called amyloidogenic pathway and the so-called
    non-amyloidogenic pathway. It is shown that the cross-talk
    between these two pathways accounts for the increase in A?
    production in response to inhibitor, i.e. an increase in C99
    will inhibit the non-amyloidogenic pathway, redirecting APP to
    be cleaved by ?-secretase, leading to an additional increase in
    C99 that overcomes the loss in ?-secretase activity. With a
    minor extension, the model also describes plasma A? profiles
    observed in humans upon dosing with a ?-secretase inhibitor. In
    conclusion, this mechanistic model rationalizes a series of
    experimental results that spans from in vitro to in vivo and to
    humans. This has important implications for the development of
    drugs targeting A? production in Alzheimer disease.</p>
