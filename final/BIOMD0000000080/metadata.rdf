    <p>This model reproduces figure 5 and figure 4(B)of the paper, with Kinh represented by [G-GTP]. We arbitrarily chosed to set the initial concentration of D to 31 micorMolar based on legend of figure 4. [R] was not given anywhere in the paper and was chosen to calibrate the sigmoid response to an increased [GTP]. THe figure 5 in the model was successfully simulated on COPASI 4.0 ,the figure 4(B) was sucessfully simulated on both COPASI and SBML_odeSolver.</p>
    <p>There are two curves for Kinh in the absence and presence of NaCl in the figure obtained from simulations of the model using parameters of set C and set D.Here in the model the initial value given is from set D.The parameters in set C :k7=0.5, k10=1.0,k5=0.1,the others are the same with set D.</p>
