    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>A. V. Hill&apos;s 1938 paper &quot;The heat of shortening and the
    dynamic constants of muscle&quot; is an enduring classic, presenting
    detailed methods, meticulous experiments, and the model of
    muscle contraction that now bears Hill&apos;s name. Pairing a
    simulation based on Hill&apos;s model with a reading of his paper
    allows students to follow his thought process to discover key
    principles of muscle physiology and gain insight into how to
    develop quantitative models of physiological processes. In this
    article, the experience of the author using this approach in a
    graduate biomedical engineering course is outlined, along with
    suggestions for adapting this approach to other audiences.</p>
