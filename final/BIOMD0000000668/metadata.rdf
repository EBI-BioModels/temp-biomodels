    &lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="bibo:abstract"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Combination chemotherapy is standard treatment for
    pancreatic cancer. However, current drugs lack efficacy for
    most patients, and selection and evaluation of new combination
    regimens is empirical and time-consuming. The efficacy of
    gemcitabine, a standard-of-care agent, combined with
    birinapant, a pro-apoptotic antagonist of Inhibitor of
    Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs), was investigated in pancreatic
    cancer cells. PANC-1 cells were treated with vehicle,
    gemcitabine (6, 10, 20 nM), birinapant (50, 200, 500 nM), and
    combinations of the two drugs. Temporal changes in cell
    numbers, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis were measured.
    A basic pharmacodynamic (PD) model based on cell numbers, and a
    mechanism-based PD model integrating all measurements, were
    developed. The basic PD model indicated that synergistic
    effects occurred in both cell proliferation and death
    processes. The mechanism-based model captured key features of
    drug action: temporary cell cycle arrest in S phase induced by
    gemcitabine alone, apoptosis induced by birinapant alone, and
    prolonged cell cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis induced by
    the combination. A drug interaction term Ψ was employed in
    the models to signify interactions of the combination when data
    were limited. When more experimental information was utilized,
    Ψ values approaching 1 indicated that specific mechanisms
    of interactions were captured better. PD modeling identified
    the potential benefit of combining gemcitabine and birinapant,
    and characterized the key interaction pathways. An optimal
    treatment schedule of pretreatment with gemcitabine for 24-48 h
    was suggested based on model predictions and was verified
    experimentally. This approach provides a generalizable modeling
    platform for exploring combinations of cytostatic and cytotoxic
    agents in cancer cell culture studies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
