    &lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="bibo:abstract"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;BACKGROUNDS: The process of amyloid proteins aggregation
    causes several human neuropathologies. In some cases, e.g.
    fibrillar deposits of insulin, the problems are generated in
    the processes of production and purification of protein and in
    the pump devices or injectable preparations for diabetics.
    Experimental kinetics and adequate modelling of chemical
    inhibition from amyloid aggregation are of practical importance
    in order to study the viable processing, formulation and
    storage as well as to predict and optimize the best conditions
    to reduce the effect of protein nucleation. RESULTS: In this
    manuscript, experimental data of insulin, A?42 amyloid protein
    and apomyoglobin fibrillation from recent bibliography were
    selected to evaluate the capability of a bivariate sigmoid
    equation to model them. The mathematical functions (logistic
    combined with Weibull equation) were used in reparameterized
    form and the effect of inhibitor concentrations on kinetic
    parameters from logistic equation were perfectly defined and
    explained. The surfaces of data were accurately described by
    proposed model and the presented analysis characterized the
    inhibitory influence on the protein aggregation by several
    chemicals. Discrimination between true and apparent inhibitors
    was also confirmed by the bivariate equation. EGCG for insulin
    (working at pH?=?7.4/T?=?37°C) and taiwaniaflavone for
    A?42 were the compounds studied that shown the greatest
    inhibition capacity. CONCLUSIONS: An accurate, simple and
    effective model to investigate the inhibition of chemicals on
    amyloid protein aggregation has been developed. The equation
    could be useful for the clear quantification of inhibitor
    potential of chemicals and rigorous comparison among them.&lt;/p&gt;
