  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
The extracellular calcium concentration has interesting effects on bursting of pancreatic beta-cells. The mechanism underlying the extracellular Ca2+ effect is not well understood. By incorporating a low-threshold transient inward current to the store-operated bursting model of Chay, this paper elucidates the role of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration in influencing electrical activity, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and the luminal Ca2+ concentration in the intracellular Ca2+ store. The possibility that this inward current is a carbachol-sensitive and TTX-insensitive Na+ current discovered by others is discussed. In addition, this paper explains how these three variables respond when various pharmacological agents are applied to the store-operated model.
