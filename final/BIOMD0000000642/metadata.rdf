    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Worldwide, breast cancer has become the second most common
    cancer in women. The disease has currently been named the most
    deadly cancer in women but little is known on what causes the
    disease. We present the effects of estrogen as a risk factor on
    the dynamics of breast cancer. We develop a deterministic
    mathematical model showing general dynamics of breast cancer
    with immune response. This is a four-population model that
    includes tumor cells, host cells, immune cells, and estrogen.
    The effects of estrogen are then incorporated in the model. The
    results show that the presence of extra estrogen increases the
    risk of developing breast cancer.</p>
