  <div class="dc:description">The secreted protein Wnt activates the
heptahelical receptor Frizzled on nieghboring cells. Activation of
Frizzled causes the recruitment of additional membrane proteins
which in turn result in 1) the activation of the protein
Dishevelled via phosphorylation and 2) the activation of a
heterotrimeric G protein of unknown type. Activation of Dishevelled
results in the down-regulation of the Beta-Catenin destruction
complex which causes ubiquitination of Beta-Catenin and its
ultimate degradation via the proteasome. Inhibition of the
Beta-Catenin destruction complex yields a higher cytosolic
concentration of Beta-Catenin, which enters the nucleus, binds
various transcriptional regulatory molecules including the TCF/LEF
class of proteins, and results in the transcription of TCF/LEF
target genes. Activation of the heterotrimeric G-protein pathway in
turn activates Phospholipase C which in turn catalyzes the
catalysis of PI(4,5)P2 into DAG and IP3.

    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The Notch, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Wnt, and EGF pathways have
    long been known to influence cell fate specification in the
    developing nervous system. Here we attempted to evaluate the
    contemporary knowledge about neural stem cell differentiation
    promoted by various drug-based regulations through a systems
    biology approach. Our model showed the phenomenon of
    DAPT-mediated antagonism of Enhancer of split [E(spl)] genes
    and enhancement of Shh target genes by a SAG agonist that were
    effectively demonstrated computationally and were consistent
    with experimental studies. However, in the case of model
    simulation of Wnt and EGF pathways, the model network did not
    supply any concurrent results with experimental data despite
    the fact that drugs were added at the appropriate positions.
    This paves insight into the potential of crosstalks between
    pathways considered in our study. Therefore, we manually
    developed a map of signaling crosstalk, which included the
    species connected by representatives from Notch, Shh, Wnt, and
    EGF pathways and highlighted the regulation of a single target
    gene, Hes-1, based on drug-induced simulations. These
    simulations provided results that matched with experimental
    studies. Therefore, these signaling crosstalk models complement
    as a tool toward the discovery of novel regulatory processes
    involved in neural stem cell maintenance, proliferation, and
    differentiation during mammalian central nervous system
    development. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a
    simple crosstalk map that highlights the differential
    regulation of neural stem cell differentiation and underscores
    the flow of positive and negative regulatory signals modulated
    by drugs.</p>
