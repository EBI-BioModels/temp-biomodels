    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and its synthetic analogues
    EC23 and EC19 direct cellular differentiation by interacting as
    ligands for the retinoic acid receptor (RARÎ±,
    Î² and Î³) family of nuclear receptor
    proteins. To date, a number of crystal structures of natural
    and synthetic ligands complexed to their target proteins have
    been solved, providing molecular level snap-shots of ligand
    binding. However, a deeper understanding of receptor and ligand
    flexibility and conformational freedom is required to develop
    stable and effective ATRA analogues for clinical use.
    Therefore, we have used molecular modelling techniques to
    define RAR interactions with ATRA and two synthetic analogues,
    EC19 and EC23, and compared their predicted biochemical
    activities to experimental measurements of relative ligand
    affinity and recruitment of coactivator proteins. A
    comprehensive molecular docking approach that explored the
    conformational space of the ligands indicated that ATRA is able
    to bind the three RAR proteins in a number of conformations
    with one extended structure being favoured. In contrast the
    biologically-distinct isomer, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9CRA),
    showed significantly less conformational flexibility in the RAR
    binding pockets. These findings were used to inform docking
    studies of the synthetic retinoids EC23 and EC19, and their
    respective methyl esters. EC23 was found to be an excellent
    mimic for ATRA, and occupied similar binding modes to ATRA in
    all three target RAR proteins. In comparison, EC19 exhibited an
    alternative binding mode which reduces the strength of key
    polar interactions in RARÎ±/Î³ but is
    well-suited to the larger RARÎ² binding pocket. In
    contrast, docking of the corresponding esters revealed the loss
    of key polar interactions which may explain the much reduced
    biological activity. Our computational results were
    complemented using an in vitro binding assay based on FRET
    measurements, which showed that EC23 was a strongly binding,
    pan-agonist of the RARs, while EC19 exhibited specificity for
    RARÎ², as predicted by the docking studies. These
    findings can account for the distinct behaviour of EC23 and
    EC19 in cellular differentiation assays, and additionally, the
    methods described herein can be further applied to the
    understanding of the molecular basis for the selectivity of
    different retinoids to RARÎ±, Î² and
    Î³.</p>
