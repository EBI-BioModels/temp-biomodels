  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
A kinetic model for N-(1-deoxy-Image -fructos-1-yl)-glycine (DFG) thermal decomposition was proposed. Two temperatures (100 and 120 °C) and two pHs (5.5 and 6.8) were studied. The measured responses were DFG, 3-deoxyosone, 1-deoxyosone, methylglyoxal, acetic acid, formic acid, glucose, fructose, mannose and melanoidins. For each system the model parameters, the rate constants, were estimated by non-linear regression, via multiresponse modelling. The determinant criterion was used as the statistical fit criterion. Model discrimination was performed by both chemical insight and statistical tests (Posterior Probability and Akaike criterion). Kinetic analysis showed that at lower pH DFG 1,2-enolization is favoured whereas with increasing pH 2,3-enolization becomes a more relevant degradation pathway. The lower amount observed of 1-DG is related with its high reactivity. It was shown that acetic acid, a main degradation product from DFG, was mainly formed through 1-DG degradation. Also from the estimated parameters 3-DG was found to be the main precursor in carbohydrate fragments formation, responsible for colour formation. Some indication was given that as the reaction proceeded other compounds besides DFG become reactants themselves with the formation among others of methylglyoxal. The multiresponse kinetic analysis was shown to be both helpful in deriving relevant kinetic parameters as well as in obtaining insight into the reaction mechanism.

  <p> The model was recently updated on 9th July 2010. The reference publication has reported two models M1 and M2, where the parameter values are given for conditions A) 100<sup>o</sup>C, pH5.5, B) 120<sup>o</sup>C, pH5.5, C) 100<sup>o</sup>C, pH6.8 and D) 120<sup>o</sup>C, pH6.8. </p>
  <p> This model corresponds to the model M2 with condition 100<sup>o</sup>C, pH6.8 </p>
  <p> The model reproduces Figure 6 of the reference publication. The curation figure was recently added</p>
