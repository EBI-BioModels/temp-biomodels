  <p>The model reproduces the time profiles of Total Smad2 in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm as depicted in 2D and also the other time profiles as depicted in Fig 2.  Two parameters that are not present in the paper are introduced here for illustration purposes and they are Total Smad2n and Total Smad2c. The term kr_EE*LRC_EE has not been included in the ODE&apos;s for T1R_surf, T2R_surf and TGFbeta in the paper but is included in this model. MathSBML was used to reproduce the simulation result.</p>
