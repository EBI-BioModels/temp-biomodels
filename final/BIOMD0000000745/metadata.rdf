Abstract: 
The goal of this study is to develop an integrated, mathematical–experimental approach for understanding the interactions between the immune system and the effects of trastuzumab on breast cancer that overexpresses the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+). A system of coupled, ordinary differential equations was constructed to describe the temporal changes in tumour growth, along with intratumoural changes in the immune response, vascularity, necrosis and hypoxia. The mathematical model is calibrated with serially acquired experimental data of tumour volume, vascularity, necrosis and hypoxia obtained from either imaging or histology from a murine model of HER2+ breast cancer. Sensitivity analysis shows that model components are sensitive for 12 of 13 parameters, but accounting for uncertainty in the parameter values, model simulations still agree with the experimental data. Given theinitial conditions, the mathematical model predicts an increase in the immune infiltrates over time in the treated animals. Immunofluorescent staining results are presented that validate this prediction by showing an increased co-staining of CD11c and F4/80 (proteins expressed by dendritic cells and/or macrophages) in the total tissue for the treated tumours compared to the controls. We posit that the proposed mathematical–experimental approach can be used to elucidate driving interactions between the trastuzumab-induced responses in the tumour and the immune system that drive the stabilization of vasculature while simultaneously decreasing tumour growth—conclusions revealed by the mathematical model that were not deducible from the experimental data alone.
