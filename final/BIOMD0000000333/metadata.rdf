  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
A mathematical model is constructed to study thrombin production in human ovarian follicular fluid. The model results show that the amount of thrombin that can be produced in ovarian follicular fluid is much lower than that in blood plasma, failing to reach the level required for fibrin formation, and thereby supporting the hypothesis that in follicular fluid thrombin functions to initiate cellular activities via intracellular signalling receptors. It is also concluded that the absence of the amplification pathway to thrombin production in follicular fluid is a major factor in restricting the amount of thrombin that can be produced. Titration of the initial concentrations of the various reactants in the model lead to predictions for the amount of tissue factor and phospholipid that is required to maintain thrombin production in the follicle, as well as to the conclusion that tissue factor pathway inhibitor has little effect on the time that thrombin generation is sustained. Numerical experiments to determine the effect of factor V, which is at a much reduced level in follicular fluid compared to plasma, and thrombomodulin, illustrate the importance for further experimental work to determine values for several parameters that have yet to be reported in the literature.
