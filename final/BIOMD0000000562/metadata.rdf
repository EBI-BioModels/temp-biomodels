    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>BACKGROUND: Qualitative frameworks, especially those based
    on the logical discrete formalism, are increasingly used to
    model regulatory and signalling networks. A major advantage of
    these frameworks is that they do not require precise
    quantitative data, and that they are well-suited for studies of
    large networks. While numerous groups have developed specific
    computational tools that provide original methods to analyse
    qualitative models, a standard format to exchange qualitative
    models has been missing. RESULTS: We present the Systems
    Biology Markup Language (SBML) Qualitative Models Package
    (&quot;qual&quot;), an extension of the SBML Level 3 standard designed
    for computer representation of qualitative models of biological
    networks. We demonstrate the interoperability of models via
    SBML qual through the analysis of a specific signalling network
    by three independent software tools. Furthermore, the
    collective effort to define the SBML qual format paved the way
    for the development of LogicalModel, an open-source model
    library, which will facilitate the adoption of the format as
    well as the collaborative development of algorithms to analyse
    qualitative models. CONCLUSIONS: SBML qual allows the exchange
    of qualitative models among a number of complementary software
    tools. SBML qual has the potential to promote collaborative
    work on the development of novel computational approaches, as
    well as on the specification and the analysis of comprehensive
    qualitative models of regulatory and signalling networks.</p>
