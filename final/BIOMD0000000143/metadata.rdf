    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>We present a two-compartment model to explain the
    oscillatory behavior observed experimentally in activated
    neutrophils. Our model is based mainly on the
    peroxidase-oxidase reaction catalyzed by myeloperoxidase with
    melatonin as a cofactor and NADPH oxidase, a major protein in
    the phagosome membrane of the leukocyte. The model predicts
    that after activation of a neutrophil, an increase in the
    activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt and the delivery of
    myeloperoxidase into the phagosome results in oscillations in
    oxygen and NAD(P)H concentration. The period of oscillation
    changes from &gt;200 s to 10-30 s. The model is consistent with
    previously reported oscillations in cell metabolism and oxidant
    production. Key features and predictions of the model were
    confirmed experimentally. The requirement of the hexose
    monophosphate pathway for 10 s oscillations was verified using
    6-aminonicotinamide and dexamethasone, which are inhibitors of
    glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The role of the NADPH
    oxidase in promoting oscillations was confirmed by
    dose-response studies of the effect of diphenylene iodonium, an
    inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase. Moreover, the model predicted
    an increase in the amplitude of NADPH oscillations in the
    presence of melatonin, which was confirmed experimentally.
    Successful computer modeling of complex chemical dynamics
    within cells and their chemical perturbation will enhance our
    ability to identify new antiinflammatory compounds.</p>
