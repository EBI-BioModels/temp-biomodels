    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>This paper presents a detailed systems model of Parkinson&apos;s
    disease (PD), developed utilizing a pragmatic application of
    biochemical systems theory (BST) intended to assist
    experimentalists in the study of system behavior. This approach
    utilizes relative values as a reasonable initial estimate for
    BST and provides a theoretical means of applying numerical
    solutions to qualitative and semi-quantitative understandings
    of cellular pathways and mechanisms. The approach allows for
    the simulation of human disease through its ability to organize
    and integrate existing information about metabolic pathways
    without having a full quantitative description of those
    pathways, so that hypotheses about individual processes may be
    tested in a systems environment. Incorporating this method, the
    PD model describes alpha-synuclein aggregation as mediated by
    dopamine metabolism, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and
    lysosomal degradation, allowing for the examination of dynamic
    pathway interactions and the evaluation of possible toxic
    mechanisms in the aggregation process. Four system
    perturbations: elevated alpha-synuclein aggregation, impaired
    dopamine packaging, increased neurotoxins, and alpha-synuclein
    overexpression, were analyzed for correlation to qualitative PD
    system hypotheses present in the literature, with the model
    demonstrating a high level of agreement with these hypotheses.
    Additionally, various PD treatment methods, including levadopa
    and monoamine oxidase inhibition (MAOI) therapy, were applied
    to the disease models to examine their effects on the system.
    Future additions and refinements to the model may further the
    understanding of the emergent behaviors of the disease, helping
    in the identification of system sensitivities and possible
    therapeutic targets.</p>
