    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Oncogenesis results from changes in kinetics or in abundance
    of proteins in signal transduction networks. Recently, it was
    shown that control of signalling cannot reside in a single gene
    product, and might well be dispersed over many components.
    Which of the reactions in these complex networks are most
    important, and how can the existing molecular information be
    used to understand why particular genes are oncogenes whereas
    others are not? We implement a new method to help address such
    questions. We apply control analysis to a detailed kinetic
    model of the epidermal growth factor-induced mitogen-activated
    protein kinase network. We determine the control of each
    reaction with respect to three biologically relevant
    characteristics of the output of this network: the amplitude,
    duration and integrated output of the transient phosphorylation
    of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We confirm that
    control is distributed, but far from randomly: a small
    proportion of reactions substantially control signalling. In
    particular, the activity of Raf is in control of all
    characteristics of the transient profile of ERK
    phosphorylation, which may clarify why Raf is an oncogene. Most
    reactions that really matter for one signalling characteristic
    are also important for the other characteristics. Our analysis
    also predicts the effects of mutations and changes in gene
    expression.</p>
