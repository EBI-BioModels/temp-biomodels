  <p>This model is according to the paper of      <i>A model for the dynamics of human weight cycling</i>
          by A. Goldbeter 2006.The figure3 (A) and (B) have been reproduced by Copasi 4.0.19(development) and SBMLodeSolver.The writer of the paper did not specify any units for the metabolites, so the creator of the model did not define the units as well.Both Q and R are normalized to vary between 0 and 1.      </p>
