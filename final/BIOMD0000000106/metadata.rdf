  <p>This model is according to the paper      <i>Dynamic Simulation on the Arachidonic Acid Metabolic Network</i>
          . Figure 2A has been reproduced by SBML ode solver on line. In the original model, all the reactions are presented as ODE directly. So curator rewrite each reaction according to the semantics of the paper.  In this paper, the authors used quict complex kinetics law to describe the catalysis in the network, curators did not necessarily know all the complete meanings of the paper.      </p>
