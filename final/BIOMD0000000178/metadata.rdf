    &lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="bibo:abstract"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Experimental studies have demonstrated that botulinum
    neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) causes flaccid paralysis by a
    multi-step mechanism. Following its binding to specific
    receptors at peripheral cholinergic nerve endings, BoNT/A is
    internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently its
    zinc-dependent catalytic domain translocates into the
    neuroplasm where it cleaves a vesicle-docking protein, SNAP-25,
    to block neurally evoked cholinergic neurotransmission. We
    tested the hypothesis that mathematical models having a minimal
    number of reactions and reactants can simulate published data
    concerning the onset of paralysis of skeletal muscles induced
    by BoNT/A at the isolated rat neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and
    in other systems. Experimental data from several laboratories
    were simulated with two different models that were represented
    by sets of coupled, first-order differential equations. In this
    study, the 3-step sequential model developed by Simpson (J
    Pharmacol Exp Ther 212:16-21,1980) was used to estimate upper
    limits of the times during which anti-toxins and other
    impermeable inhibitors of BoNT/A can exert an effect. The
    experimentally determined binding reaction rate was verified to
    be consistent with published estimates for the rate constants
    for BoNT/A binding to and dissociating from its receptors.
    Because this 3-step model was not designed to reproduce
    temporal changes in paralysis with different toxin
    concentrations, a new BoNT/A species and rate (k(S)) were added
    at the beginning of the reaction sequence to create a 4-step
    scheme. This unbound initial species is transformed at a rate
    determined by k(S) to a free species that is capable of
    binding. By systematically adjusting the values of k(S), the
    4-step model simulated the rapid decline in NMJ function (k(S)
    &amp;gt;or= 0.01), the less rapid onset of paralysis in mice
    following i.m. injections (k (S) = 0.001), and the slow onset
    of the therapeutic effects of BoNT/A (k(S) &amp;lt; 0.001) in man.
    This minimal modeling approach was not only verified by
    simulating experimental results, it helped to quantitatively
    define the time available for an inhibitor to have some effect
    (t(inhib)) and the relation between this time and the rate of
    paralysis onset. The 4-step model predicted that as the rate of
    paralysis becomes slower, the estimated upper limits of
    (t(inhib)) for impermeable inhibitors become longer. More
    generally, this modeling approach may be useful in studying the
    kinetics of other toxins or viruses that invade host cells by
    similar mechanisms, e.g., receptor-mediated endocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
