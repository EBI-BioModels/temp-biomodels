  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
          A quantitative, physiology-based model of the ascending arousal system is
developed, using continuum neuronal population modeling, which involves
averaging properties such as firing rates across neurons in each population. The
model includes the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), where circadian and
homeostatic drives enter the system, the monoaminergic and cholinergic nuclei of
the ascending arousal system, and their interconnections. The human sleep-wake
cycle is governed by the activities of these nuclei, which modulate the
behavioral state of the brain via diffuse neuromodulatory projections. The model
parameters are not free since they correspond to physiological observables.
Approximate parameter bounds are obtained by requiring consistency with
physiological and behavioral measures, and the model replicates the human
sleep-wake cycle, with physiologically reasonable voltages and firing rates.
Mutual inhibition between the wake-promoting monoaminergic group and
sleep-promoting VLPO causes ;;flip-flop&apos;&apos; behavior, with most time spent in 2
stable steady states corresponding to wake and sleep, with transitions between
them on a timescale of a few minutes. The model predicts hysteresis in the
sleep-wake cycle, with a region of bistability of the wake and sleep states.
Reducing the monoaminergic-VLPO mutual inhibition results in a smaller
hysteresis loop. This makes the model more prone to wake-sleep transitions in
both directions and makes the states less distinguishable, as in narcolepsy. The
model behavior is robust across the constrained parameter ranges, but with
sufficient flexibility to describe a wide range of observed phenomena.      </p>
