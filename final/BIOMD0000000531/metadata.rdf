    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as
    Alzheimer, Parkinson, or prion diseases, the conversion of
    soluble proteins into amyloid fibrils remains poorly
    understood. Extensive &quot;in vitro&quot; measurements of protein
    aggregation kinetics have been reported, but no consensus
    mechanism has emerged until now. This contribution aims at
    overcoming this gap by proposing a theoretically consistent
    crystallization-like model (CLM) that is able to describe the
    classic types of amyloid fibrillization kinetics identified in
    our literature survey. Amyloid conversion represented as a
    function of time is shown to follow different curve shapes,
    ranging from sigmoidal to hyperbolic, according to the relative
    importance of the nucleation and growth steps. Using the CLM,
    apparently unrelated data are deconvoluted into generic
    mechanistic information integrating the combined influence of
    seeding, nucleation, growth, and fibril breakage events. It is
    notable that this complex assembly of interdependent events is
    ultimately reduced to a mathematically simple model, whose two
    parameters can be determined by little more than visual
    inspection. The good fitting results obtained for all cases
    confirm the CLM as a good approximation to the generalized
    underlying principle governing amyloid fibrillization. A
    perspective is presented on possible applications of the CLM
    during the development of new targets for amyloid disease
    therapeutics.</p>
