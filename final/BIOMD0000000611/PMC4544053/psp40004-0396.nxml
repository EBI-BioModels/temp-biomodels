All the proteins were diluted 1.7-fold and simulations were run for 60 minutes, mimicking the experimental conditions.

Using the optimized model, we systematically tested the effect of varying the initial concentrations of various proteins (active and inactive) on the TGA profile in NHP or 8DP.</p><p>Zymogens or inhibitor proteins were varied by two orders of magnitude (0.1&#x000d7; &#x02013; 10&#x000d7;) one at a time from the nominal value. TGA was then simulated in the model with perturbed protein levels and fold changes from nominal values (Y<sub>new</sub>/Y<sub>nominal</sub>) in TGA parameters were plotted (<bold>Figure</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>). As expected, FXI and FXII are predicted to have no significant effect on any TGA parameters in NHP or in 8DP. Procoagulants such as TF and anticoagulants such as ATIII and TFPI significantly affect all three measures of TGA response in both NHP and 8DP. Decreasing ATIII has the largest effect on AUC and peak; however, its impact on lag time is minimal. Similarly, decreasing PC in NHP has a larger effect on AUC and peak, but the effect on lag time is much smaller. Modulation in FVII in 8DP seems to have a greater effect on lag time, but the effect on peak thrombin and AUC seems to be muted. Based on the magnitude of change and the number of proteins that can change it, lag time is the most tightly regulated among the three parameters and therefore hardest to change by therapeutic intervention <italic>in silico</italic>, whereas peak thrombin values are most easily modulated, especially in 8DP. Full TGA profiles on varying zymogens are shown in <bold>Supplementary Figures S1&#x02013;S3</bold>.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Effects of varying zymogen and inhibitor levels in NHP and 8DP on TGA parameters.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>. Since most of the active proteins have zero value as initial concentrations, we could not use (0.1&#x000d7; &#x02013; 10&#x000d7;) nominal levels in this analysis. Thus, we picked the same concentrations 0, 0.05, 5, or 120 nM for all the active proteins, to cover both physiological and super-physiological values while allowing a comparison of sensitivity among them. Different from their corresponding zymogens, FXIa and FXIIa showed a considerable effect on all the parameters of TGA. Similarly, opposite from FV, increasing FVa has little effect on peak thrombin and AUC, but decreases lag time. FVIIa also has a smaller effect on peak and AUC, but exerts a larger effect on lag time. Interestingly, TGA from NHP seems to be more sensitive to FVIIa level increases compared with TGA from 8DP.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Effects of varying active protein levels in NHP and 8DP on TGA (lag time (a), peak thrombin (b), and AUC (c)).

<bold>a</bold>), as expected, proteins in the intrinsic pathway and common pathway (FIX, FXI, FXII, and FX) have a larger effect on aPTT than FV and FVII, for both NHP and 8DP. Among inhibitors, ATIII affects aPTT in 8DP and NHP, but TFPI and PC have no effects in either type of plasma. Overall change in aPTT is much more pronounced in 8DP than that in the NHP, probably due to higher nominal aPTT levels in hemophilia patients.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Effects of varying zymogen, inhibitor, and active protein levels in NHP and 8DP on aPTT.

FIXa is the most sensitive factor in NHP. Addition of higher levels of FIXa have a large-scale effect in aPTT, and have not been plotted so as to preserve the scale of the plot. The model predicted a relatively high concentration (120 nM) of FVIIa is needed to shorten aPTT in 8DP to NHP levels. Finally, while FV has little effect on aPTT, an increase in FVa has a moderate effect on decreasing aPTT.

Peak thrombin is most sensitive to changes in the initial levels of coagulation protein and lag time is least sensitive to the variation of the protein levels. To understand which protein may contribute the most to the variability in TGA response to FVIIa, we applied local sensitivity analysis to the 100 sets of initial conditions representing the 100 subjects.

TGA and aPTT were chosen since they each represent the effectiveness of extrinsic and intrinsic pathway activation, respectively, and are both important assays in the clinical setting. Although PT is another commonly tested clinical assay, it is not included in the model at this time, mainly due to lack of internal data during model development. We used the optimized model to explore the effects of modulating either inactive zymogens and inhibitors or active proteins on TGA and aPTT endpoints. We also used the model to explore variability in response to FVIIa treatment.</p><p>To our knowledge, this work is a first attempt to estimate parameters in the coagulation cascade using the <italic>in vitro</italic> TGA and aPTT, for both normal plasma and FVIII-deficient plasma simultaneously, using an automated global optimization routine (simulated annealing). The optimized model was able to describe experimental results and to show dose-dependent changes in TGA parameters (lag time, peak thrombin, and AUC) and aPTT. Better fits can be obtained by optimizing only against a subset of experiments one at a time (<bold>see Supplementary Figures S7&#x02013;S10</bold> for details). A potential explanation is that this large set of experiments was conducted on different days and using different batches of plasma; these circumstances contribute to data variability, which makes it difficult to define a single set of parameter values to simultaneously fit all the data. Overall, our results suggest the underlying model structure is of sufficient complexity and can be tailored to individual datasets.</p><p>The model was then used to answer pertinent questions that arise in clinical therapy for diseases such as hemophilia. In particular, the model can be used to predict the relative sensitivity of various biomarkers when a hemostasis modulating therapy is applied. To help compare the therapy effects on different endpoints, changes in initial concentrations of zymogens or inhibitors and increasing initial concentrations of active molecules on TGA parameters and aPTT are summarized in four categories in <bold>Table</bold>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>. Different patterns of TGA and aPTT changes were observed. Some factors, e.g., FXI and FXII, change aPTT, while having a minimal effect on the TGA parameters. FX, however, changes both the TGA profile as well as aPTT. On the other end of the spectrum, some coagulation factors, e.g., FV and FVII, affect TGA but have no effect on aPTT. The three parameters used to characterize the TGA profile tend to either change or stay unchanged together, although the magnitude of change could be different. It is, however, important to note that in none of the simulations where initial levels of proteins were varied do we observe a maximum or minimum in the TGA parameters or aPTT. The behavior of these parameters can be characterized by an asymptotically increasing or decreasing trend. This probably suggests that there is no &#x0201c;sweet spot&#x0201d; of dose which could give maximum TGA or minimum aPTT results, although these parameters do plateau with increasing or decreasing dose. The model also predicts differences in the response of NHP and 8DP. In summary, modulating protein levels can have different effects on different biomarkers (i.e., TGA vs. aPTT), depending on their location in the intrinsic, extrinsic or common pathway, their activation status, and on the type of plasma under consideration.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison between the magnitude of changes in TGA

An extensive analysis of TGA profiles in congenital deficiency of coagulation factors was performed by Dieri <italic>et al</italic>. in which the authors measured the effect of severe, moderate, or mild deficiency of several coagulation factors, including FXII, FXI, FV, FVII, and FX on TGA.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Overall, our model correctly predicts the trend in TGA change due to factor depletion. On a few occasions, the model prediction does not match the experimental observation quantitatively, e.g., the impact of FV deficiency on TGA is seen only when FV levels are &#x0223c;1&#x02013;2% of normal, but our simulations show changes in TGA parameters with 10% of FV levels (<bold>Figure</bold>

Using TGA as the endpoint, we showed significant variation in the TGA profile when the same concentration of FVIIa was added. We then used the model to further explore which of the coagulation factors may contribute most to variability in response. ATIII and TFPI were the two most sensitive parameters, suggesting that the ATIII and TFPI level could be used as a biomarker to predict how well a patient will respond to FVIIa treatment.</p><p>Based on the model simulation, modulations of different targets have clearly different effects on different endpoints. This information will be helpful when choosing endpoints to measure in clinical studies and help provide a mechanistic explanation for when changes are observed or not. The linkage of these pharmacodynamics endpoints to clinical efficacy (i.e., cessation of bleeding) has not been well established as of yet. In the future, the model could be expanded to mechanistically bridge this linkage by adding interactions with platelets and endothelial cells at the site of clot formation, which also play a critical role in stopping blood loss at the injury site, in addition to the proteins in the circulating blood, incorporating blood flow dynamics and including dynamics of clot formation.<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Steven Arkin, William S.
