    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The soluble form of guanylate cyclase (sGC) is the only
    definitive receptor for the signaling agent nitric oxide (.NO).
    The enzyme is a heterodimer of homologous subunits in which
    each subunit binds 1 equiv of 5-coordinate high-spin heme. .NO
    increases the Vmax of sGC up to 400-fold and has previously
    been shown to bind to the heme to form a 5-coordinate complex.
    Using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, it is demonstrated that
    the binding of .NO to the heme of sGC is a complex process. .NO
    first binds to the heme to form a 6-coordinate nitrosyl
    complex, which then converts to a 5-coordinate nitrosyl complex
    through one of two ways. For 28 +/- 4% of the heme, the
    6-coordinate nitrosyl complex rapidly (approximately 20 s-1)
    converts to the 5-coordinate complex. For the remaining 72 +/-
    4% of the heme, the conversion of the 6-coordinate nitrosyl
    complex to a 5-coordinate nitrosyl complex is slow (0.1-1.0
    s-1) and is dependent upon the interaction of .NO with an
    unidentified non-heme site on the protein. The heme (200 nM)
    was completely converted to the 5-coordinate state with as
    little as 500 nM .NO, and the equilibrium dissociation constant
    of .NO for activating the enzyme was determined to be &lt; or =
    250 nM. Gel-filtration analysis indicates that the binding of
    .NO to the heme has no effect on the native molecular mass of
    the protein. Correlation of electronic absorption spectra with
    activity measurements indicates that the 5-coordinate nitrosyl
    form of the enzyme is activated relative to the resting
    5-coordinate ferrous form of the enzyme.</p>
