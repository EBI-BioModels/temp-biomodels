  <pre>ODE model describing how slight variations in Notch and Delta cellular concentrations, through lateral inhibition, lead to cells with different states of differentiation. Lateral inhibition is a process whereby a given cell adopting a given fate prevents its immediate neighbouring cells from doing likewise. Notch and Delta are interacting transmembrane proteins and according to this model, lateral inhibition is due to a process where the inhibited cells (where notch has been activated by Delta) loose their ability to inhibit other cells (by synthesizing Delta). This process creates a feedback loop where cells with more delta proteins on their surface inhibit their immediate neighbours and adopt a different cell fate than those neighbours.</pre>
