    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Building on the work of Martinov et al. (2000), a
    mathematical model is developed for the methionine cycle. A
    large amount of information is available about the enzymes that
    catalyse individual reaction steps in the cycle, from
    methionine to S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine to
    homocysteine, and the removal of mass from the cycle by the
    conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine. Nevertheless, the
    behavior of the cycle is very complicated since many substrates
    alter the activities of the enzymes in the reactions that
    produce them, and some can also alter the activities of other
    enzymes in the cycle. The model consists of four differential
    equations, based on known reaction kinetics, that can be solved
    to give the time course of the concentrations of the four main
    substrates in the cycle under various circumstances. We show
    that the behavior of the model in response to genetic
    abnormalities and dietary deficiencies is similar to the
    changes seen in a wide variety of experimental studies. We
    conduct computational &quot;experiments&quot; that give understanding of
    the regulatory behavior of the methionine cycle under normal
    conditions and the behavior in the presence of genetic
    variation and dietary deficiencies.</p>
