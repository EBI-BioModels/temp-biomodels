    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>In order to improve the interpretation of functional
    neuroimaging data, we implemented a mathematical model of the
    coupling between membrane ionic currents, energy metabolism
    (i.e., ATP regeneration via phosphocreatine buffer effect,
    glycolysis, and mitochondrial respiration), blood-brain barrier
    exchanges, and hemodynamics. Various hypotheses were tested for
    the variation of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen
    (CMRO(2)): (H1) the CMRO(2) remains at its baseline level; (H2)
    the CMRO(2) is enhanced as soon as the cerebral blood flow
    (CBF) increases; (H3) the CMRO(2) increase depends on
    intracellular oxygen and pyruvate concentrations, and
    intracellular ATP/ADP ratio; (H4) in addition to hypothesis H3,
    the CMRO(2) progressively increases, due to the action of a
    second messenger. A good agreement with experimental data from
    magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI and MRS) was
    obtained when we simulated sustained and repetitive activation
    protocols using hypotheses (H3) or (H4), rather than hypotheses
    (H1) or (H2). Furthermore, by studying the effect of the
    variation of some physiologically important parameters on the
    time course of the modeled blood-oxygenation-level-dependent
    (BOLD) signal, we were able to formulate hypotheses about the
    physiological or biochemical significance of functional
    magnetic resonance data, especially the poststimulus undershoot
    and the baseline drift.</p>
