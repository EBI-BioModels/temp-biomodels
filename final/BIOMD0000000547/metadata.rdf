    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Arsenic has a dual role as causative and curative agent of
    human disease. Therefore, there is considerable interest in
    elucidating arsenic toxicity and detoxification mechanisms. By
    an ensemble modelling approach, we identified a best
    parsimonious mathematical model which recapitulates and
    predicts intracellular arsenic dynamics for different
    conditions and mutants, thereby providing novel insights into
    arsenic toxicity and detoxification mechanisms in yeast, which
    could partly be confirmed experimentally by dedicated
    experiments. Specifically, our analyses suggest that: (i)
    arsenic is mainly protein-bound during short-term (acute)
    exposure, whereas glutathione-conjugated arsenic dominates
    during long-term (chronic) exposure, (ii) arsenic is not stably
    retained, but can leave the vacuole via an export mechanism,
    and (iii) Fps1 is controlled by Hog1-dependent and
    Hog1-independent mechanisms during arsenite stress. Our results
    challenge glutathione depletion as a key mechanism for arsenic
    toxicity and instead suggest that (iv) increased glutathione
    biosynthesis protects the proteome against the damaging effects
    of arsenic and that (v) widespread protein inactivation
    contributes to the toxicity of this metalloid. Our work in
    yeast may prove useful to elucidate similar mechanisms in
    higher eukaryotes and have implications for the use of arsenic
    in medical therapy.</p>
