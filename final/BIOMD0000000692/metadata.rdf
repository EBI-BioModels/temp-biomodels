    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Individual rate constants have been determined for each step
    of the Ras.GTP hydrolysis mechanism, activated by
    neurofibromin. Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy
    stopped-flow measurements used the fluorescent GTP analogue,
    mantGTP (2&apos;(3&apos;)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)GTP), to determine rate
    constants for binding and release of neurofibromin. Quenched
    flow measurements provided the kinetics of the hydrolytic
    cleavage step. The fluorescent phosphate sensor, MDCC-PBP was
    used to measure phosphate release kinetics. Phosphate-water
    oxygen exchange, using (18)O-substituted GTP and inorganic
    phosphate (P(i)), was used to determine the extent of reversal
    of the hydrolysis step and of P(i) binding. The data show that
    neurofibromin and P(i) dissociate from the NF1.Ras.GDP.P(i)
    complex with identical kinetics, which are 3-fold slower than
    the preceding cleavage step. A model is presented in which the
    P(i) release is associated with the change of Ras from &quot;GTP&quot; to
    &quot;GDP&quot; conformation. In this model, the conformation change on
    P(i) release causes the large change in affinity of
    neurofibromin, which then dissociates rapidly.</p>
