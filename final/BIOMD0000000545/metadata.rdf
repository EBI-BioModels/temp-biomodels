    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Long-wavelength and low-fluence UV-B light is an
    informational signal known to induce photomorphogenic
    development in plants. Using the model plant Arabidopsis
    thaliana, a variety of factors involved in UV-B-specific
    signaling have been experimentally characterized over the past
    decade, including the UV-B light receptor UV resistance locus
    8; the positive regulators constitutive photomorphogenesis 1
    and elongated hypocotyl 5; and the negative regulators cullin4,
    repressor of UV-B photomorphogenesis 1 (RUP1), and RUP2.
    Individual genetic and molecular studies have revealed that
    these proteins function in either positive or negative
    regulatory capacities for the sufficient and balanced
    transduction of photomorphogenic UV-B signal. Less is known,
    however, regarding how these signaling events are
    systematically linked. In our study, we use a systems biology
    approach to investigate the dynamic behaviors and correlations
    of multiple signaling components involved in Arabidopsis
    UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis. We define a mathematical
    representation of photomorphogenic UV-B signaling at a temporal
    scale. Supplemented with experimental validation, our
    computational modeling demonstrates the functional interaction
    that occurs among different protein complexes in early and
    prolonged response to photomorphogenic UV-B.</p>
