    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Transcription by the nuclear factor of activated T cells
    (NFAT) is regulated by the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillation.
    However, why and how Ca(2+) oscillation regulates NFAT activity
    remain elusive. NFAT is dephosphorylated by Ca(2+)-dependent
    phosphatase calcineurin and translocates from the cytoplasm to
    the nucleus to initiate transcription. We analyzed the kinetics
    of dephosphorylation and translocation of NFAT. We show that
    Ca(2+)-dependent dephosphorylation proceeds rapidly, while the
    rephosphorylation and nuclear transport of NFAT proceed slowly.
    Therefore, after brief Ca(2+) stimulation, dephosphorylated
    NFAT has a lifetime of several minutes in the cytoplasm. Thus,
    Ca(2+) oscillation induces a build-up of dephosphorylated NFAT
    in the cytoplasm, allowing effective nuclear translocation,
    provided that the oscillation interval is shorter than the
    lifetime of dephosphorylated NFAT. We also show that Ca(2+)
    oscillation is more cost-effective in inducing the
    translocation of NFAT than continuous Ca(2+) signaling. Thus,
    the lifetime of dephosphorylated NFAT functions as a working
    memory of Ca(2+) signals and enables the control of NFAT
    nuclear translocation by the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillation at
    a reduced cost of Ca(2+) signaling.</p>
