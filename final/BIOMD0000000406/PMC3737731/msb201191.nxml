Fluctuations in these parameters lead to various cellular defects. Overexpression of genes involved in proliferation of cancer cells due to gene amplification is a prime example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Albertson, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, in order to maintain cellular functions despite environmental change, mutation, and noise in intracellular biochemical reactions, these parameters may have certain permissible ranges, a characteristic termed robustness, which is commonly observed in various cellular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Barkai and Leibler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Little et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">von Dassow et al, 2000</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported a method designated genetic &#x02018;tug-of-war (gTOW),' by which we can measure the limit of gene overexpression in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moriya et al, 2006</xref>). In gTOW, a target gene with its native regulatory regions is cloned into a particular plasmid, and the copy number of the plasmid is increased by genetic selection. Next, the copy number is measured just before the cellular system halts (i.e., the cell dies), such that the overexpression limit of the target gene is evaluated as the gene copy number limit. As the gene copy number increases, relative overexpression of the gene is expected. If we can measure the copy number limit of gene overexpression, we can evaluate the degree to which the cellular system resists overexpression of the target gene (namely, robustness versus gene overexpression).</p><p>Using gTOW, we previously measured the copy number limits of 30 cell-cycle regulators in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moriya et al, 2006</xref>). The data were used to reveal the robustness profile of the cell-cycle regulatory system, and to evaluate and refine the integrative mathematical model of the budding yeast cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moriya et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kaizu et al, 2010</xref>). The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is distantly related to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Sipiczki, 2000</xref>), and like <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, is an established model eukaryote for the study of the molecular biology of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Egel, 2004</xref>). In this study, we developed a gTOW method using <italic>S. pombe</italic> and determined the copy number limits of 31 cell-cycle regulators. The data thus obtained were used to compare the robustness profiles of budding and fission yeasts in order to reveal the conserved/non-conserved properties of the eukaryotic cell cycle. The data were also used to constitute an integrative mathematical model of the fission yeast cell cycle.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Development of plasmid vectors used for <italic>S. pombe</italic> gTOW</title><p>The scheme of <italic>S. pombe</italic> gTOW is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>. The plasmid for gTOW must have the following properties: (1) the copy number in each cell is multiple; (2) the copy number is diverse in each cell; and (3) the plasmid contains a gene with a selection bias for increasing the plasmid copy number (<italic>leu2d</italic> in the case of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> gTOW). Because <italic>S. pombe</italic> possesses no plasmid with the above properties, we first constructed plasmid vectors for use in <italic>S. pombe</italic> gTOW.</p><p>Given below is a brief summary of the construction of the plasmid (details are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>). We used pDblet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Brun et al, 1995</xref>) for the backbone of the plasmid because it satisfies properties 1 and 2 above, and built <italic>S. cerevisiae LEU2</italic> with promoter deletions into the plasmid to satisfy property 3. We first used <italic>S. cerevisiae leu2d</italic> (a <italic>LEU2</italic> allele used in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> gTOW). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the selection bias of <italic>leu2d</italic> to increase the plasmid copy number can be controlled by the leucine concentration in the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moriya et al, 2006</xref>). However, this proved impossible in <italic>S. pombe</italic> because the final copy numbers of the <italic>leu2d</italic> plasmid (pTOWsp-H) were the same in media containing different leucine concentrations (data not shown). This is probably due to differences in the leucine-sensing mechanism between the yeasts. We thus optimized lengths of the <italic>LEU2</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) and developed three independent gTOW vectors (pTOWsp-L, pTOWsp-M, and pTOWsp-H) with different biases to increase plasmid copy numbers in <italic>leu1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Average plasmid copy numbers of the plasmids in the <italic>leu1</italic>&#x00394; cell in the leucine&#x0002b; media (uracil&#x02212; selection) were 8.5&#x000b1;3.3 (all three plasmids showed no difference), and in the leucine&#x02212; media were &#x0223c;41.3&#x000b1;13.0, 55.4&#x000b1;11.3, and 116.8&#x000b1;7.0, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Differences between the gTOW vectors in <italic>S. cerevisiae and S. pombe</italic> are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>.</p><p>In each plasmid, Ura4-EGFP was expressed, such that distribution of the plasmid copy number within populations could be monitored. Distribution of the cells for each of the plasmids analyzed by flow cytometry is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>. In the leucine&#x0002b; condition (orange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>), the plasmids tended to become lost because a portion of the cells showed the same fluorescence as the negative control (gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). The average GFP fluorescence and copy number showed good correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>), which indicates that GFP fluorescence is also useful in estimating the plasmid copy number within the cell.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Measuring copy number limits of cell division cycle regulator (<italic>cdc</italic>) genes using gTOW</title><p>We first selected 31 <italic>cdc</italic> genes (except <italic>byr4</italic>&#x0002b;, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>) and measured their copy number limits using gTOW. These genes contain orthologs of the budding yeast <italic>cdc</italic> genes, which we had previously analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moriya et al, 2006</xref>). They also contained genes implemented into an integrative mathematical model described below. In gTOW, one needs to measure by how much the expression of a target gene can be increased from the native expression level; hence, whole regulatory elements on the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; regions of the target ORF should be cloned into the plasmids. We thus cloned each target gene just before and after the neighboring ORFs (the case of <italic>cdc2</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref> as an example). In addition, we introduced frameshift mutations in five genes just after their start codons to test whether proteins expressed by these genes determine copy number limits (the structure of the frameshift mutant of <italic>cdc2</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref> as an example).</p><p>Each gene was cloned into pTOWsp-L, -M, and -H vectors, and at least two independent clones were studied for each gene. <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells with each plasmid were grown in leucine&#x0002b; and leucine&#x02212; (uracil&#x02212;) media. After 48 h of cultivation for pTOWsp-L and -M plasmids and 72 h for pTOWsp-H plasmid, plasmid copy numbers within the cells and GFP fluorescence of the cells were measured and cellular morphologies were observed. Cell size distribution was also monitored as forward scattering (FSC) by flow cytometry, and some examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>. Using combinations of leucine&#x0002b; and leucine&#x02212; conditions with three vectors, the copy number limit of each gene could be determined precisely (second and third columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Using fluorescent microscopy, we could assess how cells with high target gene copy numbers (brighter GFP fluorescence) died (fifth and sixth columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). For example, in the case of <italic>cdc25</italic>, the copy number limit could be determined by the pTOWsp-M vector, and cells became smaller in the leucine&#x02212; condition. In the case of <italic>rum1</italic>, both cells and nuclei enlarged, while in the case of <italic>spg1,</italic> cells showed multiple septation. The pTOWsp-H vector for these genes showed a very strong bias for cells with the plasmid in the leucine&#x02212; condition (red graphs in the FACS histogram in the third column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In addition, when we analyzed the gTOW experiments by time-lapse microscopy, we could assess how cells with high target gene copy numbers died. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> shows an example of time-lapse observation of a gTOW experiment with the target gene <italic>mik1</italic>&#x0002b;, which encodes a mitotic inhibitory kinase. Daughter cells with unequally distributed plasmid copy numbers had different fates; cells with low plasmid copy numbers barely grew, and after two cellular divisions growth ceased completely (black arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Cells with high plasmid copy numbers grew faster because they produced leucine but were unable to divide, resulting in elongation and eventual death (white arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). On the other hand, cells with a balanced plasmid copy number maintained normal growth and division and accumulated in the media (yellow arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The copy number limits varied from 1 (one extra copy of the endogenous copy number kills the cell) to &#x0003e;100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that the cell-cycle regulatory system has a different robustness against overexpression of each gene, as observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cell-cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moriya et al, 2006</xref>). The frameshift mutants generally showed much higher copy number limits than the wild types (orange bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>), but the frameshift mutants of <italic>wee1</italic> and <italic>rum1</italic> had lower limits than the pTOWsp-H vector alone, probably because their frameshifts do not completely shut down protein expression. The morphology of cells with high copy frameshift mutant genes was similar to that of cells with high copies of their wild types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Comparison of robustness profiles of cell-cycle regulation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic></title><p>We next compared the copy number limits of the <italic>cdc</italic> genes determined in this study with that of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homologs determined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moriya et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). <italic>S. pombe</italic> genes generally had lower copy number limits (average=52) than those of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (average=87). We previously reported that <italic>cdc</italic> genes with lower limits constituted a fragile core that directly regulates the activity of B-type cyclin Cdk (Cyclin-dependent kinase) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moriya et al, 2006</xref>). The orthologs that constitute the core structure of <italic>S. pombe</italic> (Cdc13, Rum1, and Wee1) also demonstrated low limits, which may indicate the presence of a conserved fragile core in eukaryotic cell-cycle regulation. In contrast, the orthologous components of the mitotic exit network (MEN) of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> showed very different limits from those in the septation-initiation network (SIN) of <italic>S. pombe</italic>, although both networks have conserved architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bardin and Amon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Krapp and Simanis, 2008</xref>). This might reflect the different physiologic functions in the two yeasts (namely, budding and fission), although these components have the same origin. These results suggest that comparison of robustness profiles is a useful way to reveal the conserved/non-conserved properties of cellular systems.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Dosage imbalance causes very low limit of <italic>spg1</italic></title><p>We recently demonstrated that the M-phase phosphatase gene <italic>CDC14</italic> has a very low limit is because of the dosage imbalance between <italic>CDC14</italic> and its inhibitor gene, <italic>NET1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kaizu et al, 2010</xref>). Hence, we investigated whether the low limit of <italic>spg1</italic>, the lowest copy number gene in <italic>S. pombe</italic> cell-cycle regulators evaluated in this study, was also due to dosage imbalance. <italic>spg1</italic> encodes a small GTPase involved in the initiation of cellular septation; this activity is regulated by the bipartite GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which is encoded by both <italic>cdc16</italic> and <italic>byr4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Furge et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). The copy number limit of <italic>cdc16</italic> is quite high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>), and cells with high copy <italic>cdc16</italic> did not show any obvious phenotype (data not shown). In contrast, the limit of <italic>byr4</italic> was very low (1.8&#x000b1;0.2, measured by pTOWsp-L in the leucine&#x0002b; condition). And cellular lethality due to overexpression of <italic>spg1</italic> is nullified by the simultaneous overexpression of <italic>byr4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Furge et al, 1998</xref>). We thus assume that proper activation of Spg1 is in delicate balance with Byr4, and hence, the limits of both <italic>spg1</italic> and <italic>byr4</italic> are quite low. To investigate whether <italic>spg1</italic> and <italic>byr4</italic> were in dosage balance, we performed two-dimensional (2D) gTOW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kaizu et al, 2010</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>, <italic>byr4</italic> limits increased only when multicopy <italic>spg1</italic> was supplied by another plasmid. Moreover, their copy numbers were balanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>, dotted line). Microscopic observation also confirmed our assumption that cells can divide normally only when <italic>spg1</italic> and <italic>byr4</italic> expressions are balanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results strongly support the theory that <italic>spg1</italic> has a very low limit because of the sensitive balance required for GTPase activity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Development of an integrative mathematical model that reproduces the robustness of cell-cycle regulation in <italic>S. pombe</italic></title><p>Robustness can be a measure of plausibility in mathematical models of biological networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Morohashi et al, 2002</xref>). We previously used copy number limits obtained for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> gTOW to evaluate and refine an integrative mathematical model of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Chen et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moriya et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kaizu et al, 2010</xref>). We thus evaluated and refined the integrative mathematical model, such that the model reproduces robustness (copy number limits of genes) of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> cell cycle obtained from this study. We previously published a mathematical model for <italic>S. pombe</italic> cell-cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Novak and Tyson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Sveiczer et al, 2000</xref>), and have independently modified the model from the gTOW experiment, such that the model reproduces more published experimental results. Here, we designated the model &#x02018;basic model,' the whole structure of which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref> (green components; the simplified structure is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). We first investigated to what degree the core model reproduced the copy number limits obtained in this study (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref> for details). Although we did not use the gTOW data for development of the model, the model predicted the experimental data well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref>, green circles), and appeared to capture the robustness of fission yeast cell-cycle regulation. To describe the gTOW data more extensively, we modified the basic model by adding some important regulators (M-phase phosphatase Clp1, cyclins Cig1 and Puc1) and regulations, and the parameters were optimized by-hand parameter adjustments (we designated the model &#x02018;gTOW model,' shown in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). The model successfully reproduced the copy number limits obtained in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref>, orange squares). In addition, the model could also reproduce 42 already published mutant behaviors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S10</xref>). The result of time-course simulation of the model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>. As a result, we can claim that the presented &#x02018;gTOW' model is the most detailed model of fission yeast cell-cycle regulation so far.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Increase of each Cdc2/cyclin complex, but not the depletion of Cdc2/Cdc13 through the competition for Cdc2, determines the upper limits of cyclins (<italic>cig1</italic>, <italic>cig2</italic>, and <italic>puc1</italic>)</title><p><italic>S. pombe</italic> contains four cyclins (Cdc13, Cig1, Cig2, and Puc1), all of which bind to Cdc2 to form a Cdc2/cyclin complex that performs regulatory functions on Cdc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8A</xref>). Cdk's (like Cdc2) are thought to be in excess of cyclins, but in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> it is not tremendously so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Cross et al, 2002</xref>). It is thus possible that if cyclins compete with each other for Cdc2, overexpression of one of the cyclins would interfere in formation of other Cdc2/cyclin complexes. Especially since deletion of Cdc13 can lead to lethality, there is a chance that overexpression of the other cyclins is deleterious for the cells because Cdc2 is titrated away from Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8A-2</xref>, case2). In other words, the overexpression limit of each cyclin may be determined by the increased Cdc2/cyclin activity itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8A-2</xref>, case1) or by the reduction of Cdc2/Cdc13 complex. To answer this question, we first used the mathematical model to investigate which conditions involve cyclins in competitive situations, and the experimental means to test these conditions. In the gTOW model (and in the basic model), each cyclin is considered to form a Cdc2/cyclin complex immediately after its expression; thus, no monomer cyclins or Cdc2 would be available and one cannot simulate competition with these models. Hence, we further modified the gTOW model, such that the behavior of monomer cyclins and Cdc2 could be simulated (green components in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>).</p><p>We first investigated the parameters of the condition in which cyclin competition occurs using this model, and observed that the condition is determined by a combination of the dissociation constant of Cdc2/cyclin and total Cdc2 level, and that this condition can be experimentally evaluated by measuring the copy number limit of each cyclin in the Cdc2 overexpression condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S12</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8A-3</xref>). If the limit is decreased, then the limit should be determined by an increase in the Cdc2/cyclin activity itself; and if the limit is increased, then the limit should be determined by the reduction of Cdc2/Cdc13 (competition). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8B</xref> shows the copy number limits of <italic>cig1</italic>, <italic>cig2</italic>, and <italic>puc1</italic> with multicopy <italic>cdc2</italic>; in all cases, the limits were decreased. We thus concluded that upper limits of cyclin genes are determined because of the high Cdc2/cyclin (Cig1, Cig2, and Puc1) activity itself, but not the depletion of Cdc2/Cdc13. This conclusion is supported by the phenotypic observation of gTOW-<italic>cig1</italic>&#x0002b;, <italic>-cig2</italic>&#x0002b;, and <italic>puc1</italic>&#x0002b; cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>).

In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter has been often used to overexpress genes, but the upper limit is difficult to determine by this method. Thus, gTOW provides another means for overexpression of genes and for obtaining unique data to investigate the robustness of cellular systems in <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Robustness and fragility in cell-cycle regulation in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> appear to have conserved fragility in the subsystem that directly regulates B-type cyclin Cdk1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). Because these species are distantly related, with an evolutional distance of several hundred million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Sipiczki, 2000</xref>), fragility in B-type Cdk regulation would be conserved among eukaryotes. In contrast, networks regulating cytokinesis (MEN in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and SIN in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) showed different robustness profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>), which might reflect their different systems of cellular division (budding and fission). Hence, comparison of robustness profiles would be useful to reveal the conserved properties of cellular systems.</p><p>In the cell-cycle regulation of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Cdk1-counteracting phosphatase gene <italic>CDC14</italic> had the lowest copy number limit, the reason being dosage imbalance against the inhibitor gene <italic>NET1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kaizu et al, 2010</xref>). The relatively high copy number limit of <italic>clp1</italic>, the <italic>S. pombe</italic> ortholog of <italic>CDC14</italic>, may be explained by the fact that Clp1 does not have a stoichiometric inhibitor (it seems there is an ortholog of Net1, but acts differently; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Jin et al, 2007</xref>). In this study, we showed that the small GTPase gene <italic>spg1</italic>, the gene with the lowest copy number limit among the <italic>S. pombe</italic> cell-cycle regulators, was also in dosage balance with the GAP gene <italic>byr4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>).

Although the initial model (the basic model) was independently developed from gTOW experiments, the model predicted the experimental results well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>). This model is a quantitative model in which biochemical parameters had not been experimentally determined, but it already appears to have captured the robustness characteristics of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> cell cycle.</p><p>By addition of certain components to the model and optimization of parameters, we successfully developed a model (the gTOW model) to reproduce the gTOW data obtained in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>) and the behavior of 42 other mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S10</xref>). The model provided us with two types of predictions that should be evaluated by further research. One of these predictions concerns the effect of gene overexpression on phenotype. With simulations using the gTOW model, three different cell-cycle defects were observed due to overexpression of each gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>). Interestingly, the model predicted that <italic>rum1</italic> overexpression results in three independent phenotypes according to the level of overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>).</p><p>The other prediction concerns the copy number limits of each gene in its deletion strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S11</xref>). Upon comparison with the data <italic>in vivo</italic>, this type of prediction is quite useful to find additional regulations that are not implemented in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kaizu et al, 2010</xref>). In this study, we measured upper limits of cell-cycle regulators in four deletion mutant strains, which suggest some novel regulations in the network lacking in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9</xref>). We thus showed that the prediction of the model was quite useful reference to indicate the existence of additional (unknown) regulations conferring the robustness of the cell cycle.

(<bold>A</bold>) The four steps in the gTOW experiment. (1) Each target gene is cloned into a plasmid for gTOW. (2) The plasmid is introduced into the <italic>leu1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ura4</italic>&#x00394; cell (first selection is uracil). The plasmid copy number becomes &#x0223c;10 per cell due to <italic>ars3002</italic> &#x000d7; 2 ORI. If the copy number limit of the target gene is &#x0003c;10 per cell, then the plasmid copy number is determined according to the limit. (3) The cells are transferred into leucine&#x02212; media. In this condition, cells with a high plasmid copy number are selected according to the strength of expression of the leucine synthesizing enzyme gene <italic>LEU2.</italic> On the other hand, if the increase in the target gene (i.e., overexpression) is toxic to the cell, then the plasmid copy number must be less than the toxicity limit. The resulting tug-of-war of both selection biases determines the plasmid copy number within the cell, the number being close to the copy number limit of overexpression of the target gene. (4) To estimate the copy number limit of the target gene, the growth rate, GFP fluorescence of the cell, and the plasmid copy number within the cell are measured. In gTOW, the growth rate of the cell with the plasmid and the plasmid copy number within the cell should be mutually related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moriya et al, 2006</xref>). We observed this trend in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, but measuring growth rate with a microplate reader, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moriya et al, 2006</xref>), was unstable in this species.

The complete experimental data set is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S9</xref>. (<bold>B</bold>) Regulatory interactions among cell-cycle regulators in the fission yeast cell-cycle control network mathematically reconstituted in the gTOW model. Arrows and blocked end lines represent the simulation of synthesis (or activation) and repression of synthesis (or inhibition). Red lines indicate the potential novel regulations proposed by comparison of the gTOW model and 2D-gTOW data shown in (A). Red question marks refer the regulations with uncertain strengths in the model. Possible mechanisms for these regulations are described in Discussion.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201191-f9"/></fig><table-wrap position="float"
