    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades can operate
    as bistable switches residing in either of two different stable
    states. MAPK cascades are often embedded in positive feedback
    loops, which are considered to be a prerequisite for bistable
    behavior. Here we demonstrate that in the absence of any
    imposed feedback regulation, bistability and hysteresis can
    arise solely from a distributive kinetic mechanism of the
    two-site MAPK phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.
    Importantly, the reported kinetic properties of the kinase
    (MEK) and phosphatase (MKP3) of extracellular signal-regulated
    kinase (ERK) fulfill the essential requirements for generating
    a bistable switch at a single MAPK cascade level. Likewise, a
    cycle where multisite phosphorylations are performed by
    different kinases, but dephosphorylation reactions are
    catalyzed by the same phosphatase, can also exhibit bistability
    and hysteresis. Hence, bistability induced by multisite
    covalent modification may be a widespread mechanism of the
    control of protein activity.</p>
