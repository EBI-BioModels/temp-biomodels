    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Model based design plays a fundamental role in synthetic
    biology. Exploiting modularity, i.e. using biological parts and
    interconnecting them to build new and more complex biological
    circuits is one of the key issues. In this context,
    mathematical models have been used to generate predictions of
    the behavior of the designed device. Designers not only want
    the ability to predict the circuit behavior once all its
    components have been determined, but also to help on the design
    and selection of its biological parts, i.e. to provide
    guidelines for the experimental implementation. This is
    tantamount to obtaining proper values of the model parameters,
    for the circuit behavior results from the interplay between
    model structure and parameters tuning. However, determining
    crisp values for parameters of the involved parts is not a
    realistic approach. Uncertainty is ubiquitous to biology, and
    the characterization of biological parts is not exempt from it.
    Moreover, the desired dynamical behavior for the designed
    circuit usually results from a trade-off among several goals to
    be optimized.We propose the use of a multi-objective
    optimization tuning framework to get a model-based set of
    guidelines for the selection of the kinetic parameters required
    to build a biological device with desired behavior. The design
    criteria are encoded in the formulation of the objectives and
    optimization problem itself. As a result, on the one hand the
    designer obtains qualitative regions/intervals of values of the
    circuit parameters giving rise to the predefined circuit
    behavior; on the other hand, he obtains useful information for
    its guidance in the implementation process. These parameters
    are chosen so that they can effectively be tuned at the
    wet-lab, i.e. they are effective biological tuning knobs. To
    show the proposed approach, the methodology is applied to the
    design of a well known biological circuit: a genetic incoherent
    feed-forward circuit showing adaptive behavior.The proposed
    multi-objective optimization design framework is able to
    provide effective guidelines to tune biological parameters so
    as to achieve a desired circuit behavior. Moreover, it is easy
    to analyze the impact of the context on the synthetic device to
    be designed. That is, one can analyze how the presence of a
    downstream load influences the performance of the designed
    circuit, and take it into account.</p>
