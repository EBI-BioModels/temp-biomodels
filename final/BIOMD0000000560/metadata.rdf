    &lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="bibo:abstract"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Objective: To use a computational approach to investigate
    the cellular and extracellular matrix changes that occur with
    age in the knee joints of mice. Methods: Knee joints from an
    inbred C57/BL1/6 (ICRFa) mouse colony were harvested at
    3â€“30?months of age. Sections were stained with H&amp;amp;E,
    Safranin-O, Picro-sirius red and antibodies to matrix
    metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), nitrotyrosine, LC-3B, Bcl-2, and
    cleaved type II collagen used for immunohistochemistry. Based
    on this and other data from the literature, a computer
    simulation model was built using the Systems Biology Markup
    Language using an iterative approach of data analysis and
    modelling. Individual parameters were subsequently altered to
    assess their effect on the model. Results: A progressive loss
    of cartilage matrix occurred with age. Nitrotyrosine, MMP-13
    and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK1) staining in cartilage
    increased with age with a concomitant decrease in LC-3B and
    Bcl-2. Stochastic simulations from the computational model
    showed a good agreement with these data, once transforming
    growth factor-? signalling via ALK1/ALK5 receptors was
    included. Oxidative stress and the interleukin 1 pathway were
    identified as key factors in driving the cartilage breakdown
    associated with ageing. Conclusions: A progressive loss of
    cartilage matrix and cellularity occurs with age. This is
    accompanied with increased levels of oxidative stress,
    apoptosis and MMP-13 and a decrease in chondrocyte autophagy.
    These changes explain the marked predisposition of joints to
    develop osteoarthritis with age. Computational modelling
    provides useful insights into the underlying mechanisms
    involved in age-related changes in musculoskeletal tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
