In normal cartilage, chondrocytes maintain a dynamic equilibrium with a balance between ECM production and its proteolytic breakdown. Chondrocytes secrete cartilage-degrading enzymes such as collagenases, members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family which are the most effective proteolytic enzymes at cleaving native collagen during the loss of cartilage that characterises osteoarthritis (OA).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> OA is characterised by a disruption of the articular cartilage surface<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and MMP-13 is a key mediator within OA cartilage that plays a significant role in cartilage collagen breakdown.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are produced spontaneously and activate RAGE receptors. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by activated RAGE receptors and damaged protein (DamP) in addition to basal ROS generation via mitochondria (not shown). DamP may be degraded by lysosomes. ROS increases damage to protein, increases phosphorylation of p38MAPK and activates nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B. NF-&#x003ba;B upregulates superoxide dismutase to inhibit ROS, upregulates I&#x003ba;B to inhibit itself and activates interleukin (IL) 1. IL-1 upregulates ADAMTS-5 and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) which degrades aggrecan and collagen II, respectively. MAPK p38 leads to activation of apoptosis. There is also crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis via Beclin, Bcl2, Bax and caspases (not shown). Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) normally signals via activin receptor-like kinase-5 (ALK5) to upregulate genes involved in cartilage synthesis. ALK1 signalling increases with age and leads to upregulation of MMP-13 and so exacerbates cartilage breakdown.

In this study, we have investigated the cellular and matrix changes that occur with age in the knee joints of male mice from an established and well-characterised aged mouse colony from 3 to 30&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Some of the observed changes have been documented before, but to date, this is the first study to carry out multiple measures in a set of tissues from an aged mouse colony to enable a better understanding of the interplay between underlying complex mechanisms. We demonstrated an overall loss of cartilage matrix with evidence of type II collagen degradation alongside increased levels of MMP-13, the major collagenase in cartilage turnover, and evidence of increased levels of products of oxygen radicals with age. Cellular changes included a decrease in chondrocyte autophagy and a decrease in a marker indicative of less suppression of cell death via apoptosis. Moreover, evidence that chondrocyte cell death correlates with progression of OA in mice<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> further supports out findings. Interestingly, it has also been shown that an increase in apoptosis in OA is related to a decline in autophagy in concordance with our analysis.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Moreover, chondrocyte hypertrophy in OA has been previously reported, occurring at different times during disease progression and at different locations.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Although we did not assess hypertrophy, such cellular changes will undoubtedly contribute to the age-related cartilage changes we observed. Another limitation of the study is that the MMP-13 antibody stained both pro-MMP-13 and active MMP-13, but we also showed that collagen cleavage occurred, indicating that MMP-13 must be active.</p><p>It has been proposed that young chondrocytes are held in a quiescent state by TGF-&#x003b2; acting through the receptor ALK5.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> With age the levels of this receptor decrease, the ratio of ALK1 to ALK5 increases, so that TGF-&#x003b2; signals predominantly through ALK1. As a result, the chondrocytes develop an autolytic phenotype that degrades the surrounding matrix. In young cartilage TGF-&#x003b2; is protective but with increased signalling through ALK1, MMP-13 is upregulated and cartilage breakdown ensues. These data fit with the increased expression of ALK1, MMP-13 and CII cleavage with age found in the current study and so were incorporated in the computational model.</p><p>Loeser<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> described a senescent secretory phenotype of chondrocytes present in OA induced by random genomic damage following increased oxidative stress and a decline in proliferative and synthetic capacity with age. We observed an increase in nitrotyrosine levels with age, the levels of 8-oxo DNA are known to increase in OA cartilage, and we have previously described a decrease in SOD to precede damage in OA cartilage with resultant dysfunctional mitochondria.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> An increase in proinflammatory mediators and matrix-degrading enzymes with an increasingly resistant matrix that all contribute to the development of disease have been described;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> we also observed such changes.</p><p>The integrative computational model of the molecular mechanisms of ageing was able to reproduce the age-related changes in cartilage and provide a novel way of identifying interactions between different components. We incorporated mechanisms that were highlighted in this study or have previously shown to be important in cartilage degradation but it has been constructed in a format that can be readily extended by ourselves and others as required. Thus, the model is able to integrate information from different sources and provide a useful tool for gaining insights into the key mechanisms driving the age-related changes in cartilage.</p><p>Several transcriptomic studies have been performed examining changes in gene expression in murine OA pathogenesis.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Loeser <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> showed age-related differences in gene expression in both sham-operated control and surgically induced OA mice and demonstrated the importance of ageing in OA animal model studies confirming the need to study age-related changes in long-lived mice. Interestingly, another transcriptomic study<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> showed that chondrocytes in articular cartilage of OA mice had similar gene expression profiles with skeletal muscle which was associated with inappropriate NF-&#x003ba;B signalling, supporting findings from our computational model. The advantage of transcriptomic approaches is that new genes and pathways can be identified and thus it is possible to examine how gene expression is affected by nodes in the network. For example, Bateman <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> compared profiles from wild-type mice with mice lacking ADAMTS-5 activity and identified several genes that have an ADAMTS-5 independent role in OA. Proteomic studies are also important as changes in protein expression with age do not always correlate with gene expression although this method is still fairly new in OA research.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The disadvantage of &#x02018;omic&#x02019; approaches is that it can be difficult to work out the actual detailed mechanisms involved in initiation and progression of OA. This highlights the merit of computational models which are able to examine detailed mechanisms, simulate the temporal effects of single or multiple interventions and make testable predictions. Both approaches should be considered complementary as new information on genes and pathways gathered from transcriptomic and proteomic approaches can be used to modify and extend the current model.</p><p>We have demonstrated that a progressive loss of cartilage matrix and cellular changes occur with increasing age accompanied by an increase in the level of oxidative stress and MMP-13 in murine articular cartilage. We modelled these changes using a systems biology approach and demonstrated that oxidative damage and the IL-1 pathway are pivotal in initiating the changes that lead to the development of disease. Interestingly, the model predicts that blocking the IL-1 pathway early in disease is effective at blocking MMP-13 production while blocking ALK1-mediated MMP-13 production is much more effective in aged tissues. This finding may have implications for therapeutic interventions. It would be interesting to test the model predictions by the use of inhibitors, and the use of an OA-prone mouse model such as STR/Ort would be ideal for such future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2014-206295-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e680" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Correction notice:</bold> This article has been corrected since it was published Online First.
