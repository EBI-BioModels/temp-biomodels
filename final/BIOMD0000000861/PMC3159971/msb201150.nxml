A prime example for a system that is exposed to extremely variable ligand concentrations is the erythroid lineage. The key regulator Erythropoietin (Epo) facilitates continuous renewal of erythrocytes at low basal levels but also secures compensation in case of, e.g., blood loss through an up to 1000-fold increase in hormone concentration. The Epo receptor (EpoR) is expressed on erythroid progenitor cells at the colony forming unit erythroid (CFU-E) stage. Stimulation of these cells with Epo leads to rapid but transient activation of receptor and JAK2 phosphorylation followed by phosphorylation of the latent transcription factor STAT5. Although STAT5 is known to be an essential regulator of survival and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells, a quantitative link between the dynamic properties of STAT5 signaling and survival decisions remained unknown. STAT5-mediated responses in CFU-E cells are modulated by multiple attenuation mechanisms that operate on different time scales. Fast-acting mechanisms such as depletion of Epo by rapid receptor turnover and recruitment of the phosphatase SHP-1 control the initial signal amplitude at the receptor level. Transcriptional feedback regulators such as suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family members CIS and SOCS3 operate at a slower time scale. Despite the ample knowledge of the individual components involved, only little is known about the specific contributions of these regulators in controlling dynamic properties of STAT5 in response to a broad range of input signals. Therefore, dynamic pathway modeling is required to understand the complex regulatory network of feedback regulators.</p><p>To address these questions, we established a dual negative feedback model of JAK2/STAT5 signaling in primary erythroid progenitor cells isolated from mouse fetal livers. We provide a large data set of JAK2/STAT5 signaling dynamics employing quantitative immunoblotting, mass spectrometry and quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR measured under different perturbation conditions to calibrate our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). The structure of our model was constructed to comprise the minimal number of parameters necessary to explain the data. Thereby, we aimed at a model with fully identifiable parameters that are essential to obtain high predictive power. Parameter identifiability was analyzed by the profile likelihood approach. Applying this method, we could establish a dual negative feedback model of JAK2-STAT5 signaling with structurally and in most cases practically identifiable parameters.</p><p>A major bottle-neck in combining signal transduction events with cellular phenotypes is the discrepancy in the time scale and stimuli concentrations that are applied in the different experiments. The sensitivity of biochemical assays to determine phosphorylation events within minutes or hours after stimulation is usually lower than the threshold of sensitivity in assays to determine the physiological response after one or more days. Facilitated by the model, we were able to compute the integrated response of JAK2/STAT5 signaling components for experimentally unaddressable Epo concentrations. Our results demonstrate that the integrated response of pSTAT5 in the nucleus accurately correlates with the experimentally determined survival of CFU-E cells. This provides a quantitative link of the dependency of primary CFU-E cells on pSTAT5 activation dynamics. By correlation analysis, we could identify the early signaling phase (&#x02a7d;1 h) of STAT5 to be the most predictive for the fraction of surviving cells, which was determined &#x0223c;24 h later. Thus, we hypothesize that as a general principle in apoptotic decisions, ligand concentrations translated into kinetic-encoded information of early signaling events downstream of receptors can be predictive for survival decisions 24 h later.</p><p>After the first hour of stimulation, it is important to constrain signaling to a residual steady-state level. Constitutive phosphorylation of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway has a crucial role in the onset of polycythemia vera (PV), a disease associated with Epo-independent erythroid differentiation. The two identified transcriptional feedback proteins, CIS and SOCS3, are responsible for adjusting the phosphorylation level of STAT5 after 1 h of stimulation. Since the Epo input signal can vary over a broad range of ligand concentrations, we asked how CIS and SOCS3 can facilitate control of STAT5 long-term phosphorylation levels over the entire physiological relevant hormone concentrations. By using model simulations, we revealed that the two feedbacks are most effective at different Epo concentration ranges. Predicted by our mathematical model, the major role of CIS in modulating STAT5 phosphorylation levels is at low, basal Epo concentrations, whereas SOCS3 is essential to control the STAT5 phosphorylation levels at high Epo doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). As a potential molecular mechanism of this dose-dependent inhibitory effect, we could identify the quantity of pJAK2 relative to pEpoR that increases with higher Epo concentrations. Since SOCS3 can inhibit JAK2 directly via its KIR domain to attenuate downstream STAT5 activation, SOCS3 becomes more effective with the relative increase of JAK2 activation. Hence, CIS and SOCS3 act in a concerted manner to ensure tight regulation of STAT5 responses over the broad physiological range of Epo concentrations.</p><p>In summary, our mathematical approach provided new insights into the specific function of feedback regulation in STAT5-mediated life or death decisions of primary erythroid cells. We dissected the roles of the transcriptionally induced proteins CIS and SOCS3 that operate as dual feedback with divided function thereby facilitating the control of STAT5 activation levels over the entire range of physiological Epo concentrations. The detailed understanding of the molecular processes and control distribution of Epo-induced JAK/STAT signaling can be further applied to gain insights into alterations promoting malignant hematopoietic diseases.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Cellular signal transduction is governed by multiple feedback mechanisms to elicit robust cellular decisions. The specific contributions of individual feedback regulators, however, remain unclear. Based on extensive time-resolved data sets in primary erythroid progenitor cells, we established a dynamic pathway model to dissect the roles of the two transcriptional negative feedback regulators of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, CIS and SOCS3, in JAK2/STAT5 signaling. Facilitated by the model, we calculated the STAT5 response for experimentally unobservable Epo concentrations and provide a quantitative link between cell survival and the integrated response of STAT5 in the nucleus. Model predictions show that the two feedbacks CIS and SOCS3 are most effective at different ligand concentration ranges due to their distinct inhibitory mechanisms. This divided function of dual feedback regulation enables control of STAT5 responses for Epo concentrations that can vary 1000-fold <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our modeling approach reveals dose-dependent feedback control as key property to regulate STAT5-mediated survival decisions over a broad range of ligand concentrations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>erythropoietin</kwd><kwd>mathematical modeling</kwd><kwd>negative feedback</kwd><kwd>SOCS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells interpret information encoded by extracellular stimuli through the activation of intracellular signaling networks and link this to cellular decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Kholodenko et al, 2010</xref>). Feed-forward signaling events are counteracted by negative feedback mechanisms facilitating adaptation, stability and desensitization of input signals. Transcriptional feedback regulators that are induced as early genes have been identified as major constituent of signaling pathways such as DUSP family members for the MAPK cascade, Smad7 and Ski family members for the TGF&#x003b2;/Smad pathway and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins for JAK/STAT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Legewie et al, 2008</xref>). Importantly, these transcriptional feedback regulators are downregulated in multiple carcinomas, implying a crucial role in constraining growth factor and cytokine-induced signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Freeman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Amit et al, 2007</xref>). Despite the ample knowledge of the individual components involved, only little is known about the specific contributions of these regulators in controlling dose-dependent dynamic properties of signaling networks in response to a broad range of input signals.</p><p>A prime example for a system that is exposed to extremely variable ligand concentrations is the erythroid lineage. Key regulator of erythropoiesis is the hormone erythropoietin (Epo) that facilitates continuous renewal of short-lived erythrocytes at low basal levels of &#x0223c;15 mU/ml Epo, but also secures compensation of blood loss through an up to 1000-fold increase in hormone concentration in acute hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Jelkmann, 2004</xref>). Epo binds to the hematopoietic cytokine receptor, the Epo receptor (EpoR), that is primarily present on erythroid progenitor cells, but recently also has been uncovered on tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Lappin et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Lai et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Liang et al, 2010</xref>). In the erythroid lineage signaling through the EpoR is essential for survival, proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells at the colony forming unit erythroid (CFU-E) stage. Stimulation of these cells with Epo leads to rapid but transient activation of receptor and JAK2 phosphorylation followed by phosphorylation of the latent transcription factor STAT5. The role of STAT5a/b in erythropoiesis has been controversially discussed, but evidence based on the analysis of STAT5<sup>&#x00394;N/&#x00394;N</sup> mice that express partially functional STAT5a/b proteins and mice completely deficient of STAT5a/b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Socolovsky et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Cui et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">Yao et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kerenyi et al, 2008</xref>) suggests that STAT5 is a crucial regulator of survival and differentiation in erythroid progenitor cells. Initial studies showed that erythroid cells expressing STAT5<sup>&#x00394;N/&#x00394;N</sup>, the hypomorphic STAT5a/b proteins, exhibit elevated rates of apoptosis due to a failure of <italic>Bcl-xL</italic> upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Socolovsky et al, 2001</xref>). Subsequently, generated STAT5a/b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice displayed fatal defects in all lymphoid lineages, suffered from microcytic anemia due to enhanced apoptosis and died prenatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">Zhu et al, 2008</xref>). Recently, it was shown that STAT5 can enable erythropoiesis even in the absence of EpoR and JAK2 underscoring the essential role of STAT5 in regulating apoptosis and differentiation in erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Grebien et al, 2008</xref>). However, a quantitative link between dynamic properties of STAT5 signaling and survival decisions remained to be established.</p><p>The STAT5-mediated responses in CFU-E cells are modulated by multiple attenuation mechanisms that operate on different time scales. Fast-acting mechanisms such as depletion of Epo by rapid receptor turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Becker et al, 2010</xref>) and recruitment of the phosphatase SHP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Klingm&#x000fc;ller et al, 1995</xref>) control the initial signal amplitude at the receptor level. Transcriptional feedback regulators such as SOCS family members operate at a slower time scale and the precise impact on the kinetics of STAT5 signaling has not yet been determined. Among the eight known SOCS family members, four have been proposed in studies primarily performed with transformed (erythro-) leukemic cell lines as putative transcriptional negative regulators involved in attenuation of EpoR-JAK2/STAT5 signaling. They include cytokine-induced SH2-domain containing protein (CIS), SOCS1, SOCS2 and SOCS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Yoshimura et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Jegalian and Wu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Sarna et al, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of CIS in erythroid progenitor cells has been shown to inhibit STAT5-mediated survival signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Ketteler et al, 2003</xref>). Although the inhibitory mechanisms of these proteins are well characterized and are partially distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Endo et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Matsumoto et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Sasaki et al, 2000</xref>), a major open question was whether they have redundant or specific functions in restraining STAT5 signaling in erythroid progenitor cells.</p><p>Recently, several kinetic models of JAK/STAT signaling pathways have been established. The majority of these studies rely on previously published data and simulations focusing on control mechanisms of the IFN activated JAK1/JAK2/STAT1 pathway and feedback by SOCS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">Zi et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Soebiyanto et al, 2007</xref>) or robustness in the JAK/STAT1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Shudo et al, 2007</xref>). Up to now only few studies combine quantitative data with mathematical models. Examples are a core model of JAK2/STAT5 signaling investigating nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Swameye et al, 2003</xref>) and an IFN&#x003b1;-induced model investigating a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Maiwald et al, 2010</xref>). Understanding how transcriptional negative feedback proteins specifically regulate JAK/STAT pathway dynamics and the extent of cellular responses requires mathematical models that combine extensive time-resolved biochemical and phenotypic data.</p><p>In this study, we establish a transcriptional feedback model of JAK2/STAT5 signaling in primary erythroid progenitor cells and demonstrate that the STAT5 response integrated over time is quantitatively linked to survival decisions. Applying the model, we dissect the divided function of CIS and SOCS3 that enables to confine STAT5 phosphorylation levels at distinct ligand concentration levels. Our results imply that dual feedback regulation ensures stringent and fine-tuned control of cell survival decisions over the entire broad spectrum of physiologically relevant Epo concentrations.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Transcription-dependent regulation of STAT5 steady-state phosphorylation level</title><p>To examine the impact of transcriptional feedback regulation on Epo-induced JAK2-STAT5 signaling, we used the generic inhibitor of transcription actinomycin D and monitored the time-dependent activation of the signaling network in primary erythroid progenitors at the CFU-E stage. To confirm the effect of the actinomycin D treatment, the expression of the known Epo-induced negative regulator CIS was monitored exemplarily by quantitative immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Stimulation with Epo during 3 h of observation leads to transient phosphorylation of EpoR, JAK2 and STAT5 with rapid kinetics, followed by a decrease to a residual steady-state level. A comparison of time course data in the presence and absence of inhibitor demonstrated that the steady-state phosphorylation level of STAT5 is elevated in actinomycin D-treated cells, indicating that attenuation of this species involves <italic>de novo</italic> gene transcription. The phosphorylation kinetics of the upstream signaling components, EpoR and JAK2, however, showed no major effects compared with the profile of the untreated control. These results imply that transcriptional feedback regulators induced as immediate early genes have a central role in modulating the phosphorylation kinetics of STAT5.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sustained induction of the transcriptional feedback regulators CIS and SOCS3 in primary CFU-E cells</title><p>To identify the relevant transcriptional feedback regulators that are involved in attenuation of Epo-induced JAK2-STAT5 signaling in addition to CIS, we performed genome-wide expression profiling. Murine CFU-E cells were stimulated with Epo and the time-resolved mRNA expression profiles were analyzed to identify significantly upregulated negative feedback regulators of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The results revealed that among the eight known SOCS proteins exclusively CIS and SOCS3 showed rapid and permanent upregulation at the mRNA level in particular within the first hour, which is consistent with the presence of STAT5 consensus binding sites in the promoters of these two genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Matsumoto et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Emanuelli et al, 2000</xref>). In contrast to studies in other cells that reported upregulation of additional SOCS transcripts upon Epo stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Jegalian and Wu, 2002</xref>), neither SOCS1 nor SOCS2 mRNA induction was detected in the first hours after stimulation in CFU-E cells. This suggests that other SOCS members are either primarily expressed in transformed cell lines or as hypothesized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Sarna et al (2003)</xref> may be induced at other stages during erythroid maturation. The slight upregulation of SOCS2 mRNA after &#x0223c;20 h supports the latter hypothesis.</p><p>Additional negative regulators of Epo-induced JAK-STAT signaling such as PIAS proteins (PIAS1-4) and hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) usually do not show stimulation-dependent transcription but are constitutively expressed. To confirm this in primary erythroid progenitor cells, we compiled expression profiles of the PIAS1-4 proteins and the hematopoietic phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, PTP1B and PTPRC (CD45) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). In line with previous reports, stimulation-dependent induction of these genes was not detected. Hence, CIS and SOCS3 are the two prime candidates that can act as dual transcriptional feedback regulators of STAT5 phosphorylation levels in erythroid progenitor cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Dynamic pathway model to evaluate the biological relevance of dual transcriptional feedback</title><p>To dissect the specific roles of CIS and SOCS3 in controlling the JAK2-STAT5 signaling behavior, we implemented an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of the Epo-induced JAK2/STAT5 pathway. Our model is divided into three submodules describing events at the plasma membrane, in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). As model input, we assumed a constant Epo concentration, because the depletion of Epo in primary CFU-E cells is marginal at the high concentrations used in this study. To explain the events at the plasma membrane, EpoR and the tyrosine kinase JAK2 were modeled as a complex that is present in different activation states corresponding to the different phosphorylated species (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Material Section 2.2</xref>). The EpoRpJAK2 variable also describes phosphorylated JAK2 that is dissociated from the EpoR. Ligand-dependent attenuation, for instance by receptor internalization and dephosphorylation, was summarized by including deactivation of JAK2 and EpoR by the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 as described in a previous model of Epo-induced MAPK signaling in CFU-E cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Schilling et al, 2009</xref>). Briefly, the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, which is constitutively expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>) has previously been shown to require binding to the specific phosphorylated tyrosine residue Tyr429 on the EpoR to activate phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Pei et al, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Klingm&#x000fc;ller et al, 1995</xref>). Thus, we included an activated form of SHP-1 in our model that in turn catalyzes dephosphorylation of JAK2 and EpoR. Phosphorylation of STAT5 by JAK2 is mediated by recruiting STAT5 to phosphotyrosine 343 and 401 of the EpoR cytoplasmic domain that functions as a scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Gobert et al, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Klingm&#x000fc;ller et al, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Barber et al, 2001</xref>). Consistent with the observation that phosphorylation of STAT5 is impaired in the absence of docking sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Gobert et al, 1996</xref>), we considered that the STAT5 phosphorylation by the complex pEpoRpJAK2 must be faster than by the complex EpoRpJAK. After dimerization, the phosphorylated STAT5 translocates into the nucleus, binds to consensus sequences on the DNA and migrates back into the cytoplasm to enter a new cycle of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Swameye et al, 2003</xref>). These different forms of STAT5 were integrated in the model by three distinct variables, unphosphorylated STAT5 in the cytosol (STAT5), phosphorylated STAT5 dimers in the cytosol (pSTAT5) and phosphorylated STAT5 dimers in the nucleus (npSTAT5). To enter a new cycle of activation, STAT5 is dephosphorylated and exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm in our model by a single reaction. Since various phosphatases are known to facilitate dephosphorylation of STAT5 in the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Aoki and Matsuda, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Yu et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Hoyt et al, 2007</xref>), we assumed constitutive inactivation of STAT5 during traffic from nucleus to cytoplasm (npSTAT5 &#x02192; STAT5).</p><p>Based on our experimental evidence shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>, the STAT5 target genes <italic>CIS</italic> and <italic>SOCS3</italic> were included in the model as transcriptional feedback regulators. The production of SOCS3 and CIS transcripts was modeled using a delay that is based on the linear chain trick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">MacDonald, 1976</xref>). Based on their previously identified molecular mechanisms of inhibition, the effect of CIS and SOCS3 was included in the model. CIS was considered as inhibitor of STAT5 activation mediated by the pEpoRpJAK2 complex, because it competes with STAT5 for the same pTyr binding site on the receptor. In contrast, SOCS3 is known to bind directly to JAK2 and inhibit JAK2 activation and downstream events, i.e., phosphorylation of EpoR and STAT5. Additionally, it can bind to the phosphorylated EpoR and inhibit the recruitment of STAT5 to the specific pTyr binding sites on the EpoR as described before for CIS. Therefore, SOCS3 in the model attenuates STAT5 phosphorylation mediated by both EpoRpJAK2 and pEpoRpJAK2. (A detailed description with references is provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Material Section 2.2</xref>.) Although the effect of JAK2 inhibition by transcriptional feedback regulators was not significant as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>, we included the inhibition of JAK2 by SOCS3 since the effect could be obscured by other attenuation mechanisms, i.e., deactivation of JAK2 by SHP-1. To reduce the model complexity to the requirements of our biological question, which is important for achieving structurally and practically identifiable model parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Raue et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Chen et al, 2010</xref>), we systematically eliminated short-lived protein&#x02013;protein complexes and fast reactions. Finally, the model comprised 29 parameters describing 36 reactions and 86 nuisance parameters, such as scaling and offset parameters of the experimental data. Considering the total of 541 experimental data points the estimation uncertainties of the model parameters are small enough to allow for accurate model predictions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Material Section 2.5</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Calibration of the dual transcriptional feedback model</title><p>To estimate the model parameters multiple data sets of Epo-induced JAK2/STAT5 signaling were acquired in primary CFU-E cells using three different experimental techniques for quantitative data generation. By quantitative immunoblotting, the time-resolved activation kinetics of the experimental observables phosphorylated and total EpoR and JAK2, phosphorylated and total STAT5 as well as induction of CIS and SOCS3 expression were monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, the initial values of all proteins were determined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3; Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and dose&#x02013;response experiments were performed by determining the phosphorylation levels at the time point of maximal activation for different Epo concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S20&#x02013;S23</xref>). Since for phosphorylated proteins only relative values were obtained by immunoblotting, we used quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) with isotope-labeled standard peptides to determine site-specific phosphorylation degrees of STAT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Both STAT5a and STAT5b are activated in response to Epo stimulation and share functional roles in erythroid cells. Therefore, we performed MS analysis on STAT5b as representative for both isoforms. This approach revealed that after 10 min of Epo stimulation 73&#x00025; of STAT5 molecules are phosphorylated on Tyr694. In combination with the absolute values of the total proteins that were determined by quantitative immunoblotting, total concentrations of phosphorylated STAT5 were calculated with the model. Additionally to the observations at the protein level, expression kinetics of CIS and SOCS3 were determined at mRNA levels using quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR to validate the data from the microarray experiments and to improve the temporal resolution at early time points for parameter estimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>To provide the required information content necessary to disentangle the role of the dual negative feedback regulation, we also performed experiments applying specific perturbations. Time-resolved activation of the pathway was monitored in primary CFU-E cells that overexpressed SHP-1, CIS or SOCS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). We focused on overexpression since RNAi-mediated knockdown was not addressable with the currently available techniques in these cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Material Section 1.2</xref>). The number of time points that could be examined was limited since in primary cells the retroviral transduction efficiency is quite low (&#x0223c;20&#x00025;) and only positively transduced cells were used for the experiments. Since the level of the overexpressed proteins is high at the start of each experiment, already a reduction of the initial peak is observed in addition to the impact on the steady-state phosphorylation level. SOCS3 overexpression leads to a reduction in the phosphorylation of JAK2, whereas CIS overexpression does not have a major effect on JAK2 phosphorylation. This is in line with the previously proposed inhibitory mechanisms of both proteins, i.e., SOCS3 is blocking not only the binding of STAT5 to the receptor but can also inhibit JAK2 via its kinase inhibitory region (KIR) domain. CIS instead does not contain a KIR domain but is known to compete with STAT5 for binding to the EpoR phosphotyrosine 401 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Yoshimura et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Ketteler et al, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Based on these data sets, the parameters were simultaneously estimated by maximizing the likelihood with the MATLAB implementation of the trust-region method with user supplied derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Coleman and Li, 1996</xref>). In order to allow for normally distributed measurement noise the likelihood was evaluated in logarithmic concentration space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Kreutz et al, 2007</xref>). To account for uncertainties in the parameter estimates, the identifiability was investigated and 95&#x00025; confidence intervals were calculated by applying the profile likelihood approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Raue et al, 2009</xref>). The model parameters were structurally and, in most cases, also practically identifiable (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Model Results 2.5</xref>). In summary, our dual feedback regulation model was able to adequately represent the experimental data sets for normal and perturbed conditions, dose&#x02013;response behavior of various signaling components as well as mRNA expression and absolute phosphorylation amounts determined based on MS analysis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Model-based prediction of integrated STAT5 response in the nucleus correlates with experimentally determined survival</title><p>Next, we applied the calibrated dual feedback regulation model to examine the link of the behavior of STAT5 and the two negative feedback regulators with regard to physiological responses of cells. Since STAT5 is known to induce anti-apoptotic target gene expression in CFU-E cells, we asked if a direct relationship exists between the amount of phosphorylated STAT5 in the nucleus (npSTAT5) and the extent of survival in CFU-E cells. We focused on the integral response, which is the area under the curve, because this entity captures both the kinetics and magnitude of the signal. It has been demonstrated that processes with slow kinetics (i.e., genetic networks and cell fate decisions) downstream of processes with fast kinetics (i.e., phosphorylation-based signaling networks) act as integrators capable of measuring how long the upstream signal has been on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Behar et al, 2007</xref>). Moreover, besides cytokine responses, in MAPK signaling the integral response of a transcription factor was used previously to link ERK activity and DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Asthagiri et al, 2000</xref>). Using the dual feedback regulation model we could quantitatively assess the integral response of STAT5 even for very low Epo concentrations, which are intractable in experimental approaches but are of important physiological significance. For instance, the STAT5 phosphorylation levels elicited by Epo concentrations lower than 0.1 U/ml are below the detection limit of immunoblotting experiments, but sufficient to promote cell survival. We predicted the trajectory of npSTAT5 response for wild-type cells and additionally for cells overexpressing either SOCS3 or CIS at different Epo concentrations and calculated the area under the curve. As an example of this procedure, the model prediction of the integral STAT5 response at a single Epo concentration is depicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). As shown in the overlays of the different experimental conditions, SOCS3 overexpression is predicted to reduce the integral of pSTAT5 in the nucleus much more than overexpression of CIS.</p><p>To evaluate whether the predicted integral STAT5 response correlates with the extent of survival, we experimentally determined the percentage of apoptotic and viable primary CFU-E cells using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay in combination with flow cytometry at various Epo concentrations for wild-type and CIS or SOCS3 overexpressing cells. Here again, only four different Epo concentrations could be determined in CIS and SOCS3 overexpressing cells due to the low transduction efficiency that results in limited primary cell material. A representative example at Epo=10<sup>&#x02212;6.78</sup> U/cell is displayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>), which demonstrates that SOCS3 overexpression affects survival to a larger extent than CIS considering similar overexpression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>).</p><p>To systematically test if npSTAT5 is the major factor that contributes to survival decisions, we additionally parameterized the contributions to the survival signal of the different pathway species (pEpoR, pJAK2, npSTAT5, CIS and SOCS3) in an additive way (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Material Section 1.1</xref>). By comparing the contributions of various signaling components to the anti-apoptosis response, we detect that the npSTAT5 signal contributed &#x0003e;99&#x00025;.</p><p>As apoptosis is an all-or-none decision, we performed simulations describing the effect of intrinsic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>) and extrinsic stochasticity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>) on npSTAT5. In both cases, the trajectory of npSTAT5 is rather negligibly affected by noise and does not show bi-stability. To further analyze the direct correlation between the integral response of phosphorylated STAT5 in the nucleus and the survival decision of erythroid progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>), we investigated the induction of anti-apoptotic target genes. First, global gene expression data were used to identify a panel of Epo-regulated anti-apoptotic genes. Among the preselected candidates (Bcl-xL, BIM, Bcl-2 and Pim-1) that were previously associated with Epo-dependent regulation, exclusively Pim-1 showed rapid and significant induction compared with untreated control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7A</xref>). The dose-dependent behavior of Pim-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7B</xref>) mirrored the behavior of the integral npSTAT5 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>) and continuously increased over different Epo doses in an averaged cell population. Thus, the integral of nuclear phosphorylated STAT5 correlates with Pim-1 induction, while the individual cell fate may be influenced by cell-to-cell variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Spencer et al, 2009</xref>).</p><p>As the duration of nuclear activated STAT5 that is necessary to induce a survival response is unknown, we tested which integration time showed the strongest correlation with the experimentally determined survival. Interestingly, an integration time of &#x0223c;60 min correlated best with the experimental results as demonstrated by the log-likelihood profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). The overlay of the simulated npSTAT5 response integrated for 60 min and the experimental survival data of CFU-E cells at various Epo concentrations demonstrate a close relationship of both quantities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). Since the model was calibrated with biochemical experiments, in which different cell densities were applied than in the apoptosis assays, Epo concentrations U/ml were converted to U/cell in order to achieve comparability of conditions. The different effects of SOCS3 and CIS overexpression were adequately reflected by the model considering the obtained confidence intervals for the parameter estimates and model trajectories (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Model Results 2.5</xref>).</p><p>We concluded that the dual feedback regulation model captured the inhibitory effects of the negative feedback regulators over a broad Epo concentration range.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Distinct roles of feedback regulators facilitate control of STAT5 phosphorylation level over a broad Epo concentration range</title><p>Since CIS and SOCS3 inhibit the pathway by different mechanisms, we asked whether they might have distinct roles in controlling STAT5 phosphorylation over the entire range of physiological Epo concentrations that can vary by 1000-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Jelkmann, 2004</xref>). To investigate the impact of the transcriptional feedback regulators CIS and SOCS3 on the STAT5 steady-state phosphorylation level, we calculated the fold change of STAT5 steady-state phosphorylation at 360 min post Epo stimulation for <italic>in silico</italic> cells lacking either both negative feedback regulators (CIS-SOCS3 K.o.) or solely CIS (CIS K.o.) or SOCS3 (SOCS3 K.o.) relative to phosphorylation level in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). The increase of the pSTAT5 steady-state level was simulated over a broad Epo concentration range per cell encompassing basal (I) as well as acute (II) conditions. Exemplarily, the impact of the absence of both feedback regulators or of both individually on the time course of STAT5 phosphorylation is depicted for basal and acute Epo concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, lower panels). As expected, we observed an increase in the pSTAT5 steady-state level for the double knockout simulation over the entire Epo range. Interestingly, the single knockout simulations revealed that CIS and SOCS3 have a distinct impact on pSTAT5 phosphorylation at different Epo concentrations. This was unexpected since both proteins are expressed to similar extents and time frames after stimulation with Epo doses applied in the experiments. At low Epo concentrations, the absence of CIS resulted in an increase in the amplitude and the steady-state level of STAT5 phosphorylation while the absence of SOCS3 had no major impact. Conversely, at high Epo concentrations the steady-state level of STAT5 phosphorylation is increased in the absence of SOCS3 whereas CIS has no major effect. This synergistic action of the two feedbacks allows adjusting STAT5 phosphorylation levels over the entire concentration range of physiological Epo concentrations from basal levels up to extremely high values that occur under acute hypoxic stress.</p><p>To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanism of this dose-dependent inhibitory effect of CIS and SOCS3, we investigated the model structure and dynamics of each species of the pathway. By analyzing the components in dependence of ligand doses, we identified the observable pJAK2 relative to pEpoR as a potential explanation for the different inhibitory effects dependent on the Epo dose. With rising Epo concentrations the ratio of pJAK2 to pEpoR changes, because more JAK2 is phosphorylated relative to the EpoR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). To provide experimental evidence for this model hypothesis, we compared dose responses of pJAK2 relative to the response of pEpoR determined by immunoblotting with the model predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the model simulation of increasing pJAK2 relative to pEpoR is in good agreement with the experimentally determined ratio of both quantities at 30 min with rising Epo concentrations. Since SOCS3 is inhibiting the activation of STAT5 via both pJAK2 and pEpoR whereas CIS only blocks binding of STAT5 to the EpoR, the impact of SOCS3 increases with increasing ratio of pJAK2 versus pEpoR. Taken together, these data and the model suggest that SOCS3 inhibition becomes more important with the relative increase of JAK2 phosphorylation and thus at higher Epo doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). CIS instead inhibits the binding of STAT5 to EpoR; and thus, its inhibitory effect dominates for lower Epo doses, when the ratio of pJAK2 to pEpoR is not enhanced.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on extensive time-resolved data sets in primary erythroid progenitor cells and mathematical modeling, we dissected the different contributions of the two feedback regulators CIS and SOCS3 and identified dual transcriptional feedback effective at discrete ligand concentrations as key property of the EpoR-STAT5 signaling system. This result underlines the general principle of negative feedback regulation to increase control and stability of transcriptional responses over a broad range of input values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Becskei and Serrano, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Freeman, 2000</xref>). Our observation that multiple feedbacks are necessary to orchestrate tight regulation of transcription factor activity from very low to very high ligand doses suggests a new strategy of SOCS-mediated feedback control.</p><p>Most of the previous JAK/STAT models have a complex structure comprising a large number of variables and literature-based parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">Yamada et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">Zi et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Soebiyanto et al, 2007</xref>). In this work, as an alternative modeling strategy, a bottom-up approach was employed, which aims at fully identifiable parameters that are essential to obtain models with high predictive power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Bruggeman et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aldridge et al, 2006</xref>). We therefore employed a large set of data measured under different perturbation conditions in combination with a model structure comprising the minimal number of parameters necessary to explain the data. Parameter identifiability was analyzed by the profile likelihood approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Raue et al, 2009</xref>). Applying this method, we could establish a dual negative feedback model of JAK2-STAT5 signaling with structurally and in most cases also practically identifiable parameters.</p><p>Qualitatively, the important role of STAT5 as crucial regulator of survival and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells has been established previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Socolovsky et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">Yao et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Grebien et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">Zhu et al, 2008</xref>). We demonstrate that the calculated integrated response of pSTAT5 in the nucleus accurately correlates with the experimentally determined survival of CFU-E cells, thereby providing a quantitative link of the dependency of primary CFU-E cells on pSTAT5 activation dynamics. In line with this, a recent study that quantitatively determined pSTAT5 activity levels in IL-2 induced single T cells reported on a causal link between enhanced pSTAT5 levels and decreased cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Feinerman et al, 2010</xref>). We concluded that fine-tuned changes in STAT5 activation levels are a critical determinant for cell fate decisions. This observation is also true during an earlier differentiation stage of the erythroid lineage. A previous study showed that partial depletion of STAT5 from CD34&#x0002b; cells by a lentiviral RNAi approach in the presence of thrombopoietin and stem cell factor resulted in a decrease of erythroid progenitors (BFU-E). Conversely, overexpression of an activated STAT5a mutant strongly induced erythroid differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Olthof et al, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that the integral of npSTAT5 is a good predictor for survival does not imply that survival is exclusively depending on STAT5. The integral of STAT5 activity in the nucleus transfers quantitative information about extracellular ligand concentrations to downstream signals, i.e., expression of anti-apoptotic target genes such as <italic>Pim-1</italic> that contribute to the ultimate cellular response. Additional pro-survival factors such as the PI3K/AKT pathway that have been shown previously to be involved in prevention of apoptosis in CFU-E cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Bouscary et al, 2003</xref>) may also contribute. However, overexpression of constitutively active AKT could not substitute for the apoptosis-suppressing function of the EpoR-STAT5 pathway in JAK2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ghaffari et al, 2006</xref>). Hence, though we cannot rule out the involvement of other pathways, our study underlines the direct relationship of the integral STAT5 response and survival decisions of primary erythroid progenitor cells.</p><p>A major bottle-neck in combining signal transduction events with cellular phenotypes is the discrepancy in the time scale and stimuli concentrations that are applied in the different experiments. The sensitivity of biochemical assays to determine phosphorylation events within minutes or hours after stimulation is usually lower than the threshold of sensitivity in assays to determine the physiological response after one or more days. By employing our mathematical model, we were able to compute the integrated response of STAT5 at Epo concentrations that are beyond the threshold of biochemical experiments. This allowed us to directly link the activation status of the transcription factor with a cellular response. By correlation analysis, we could identify the early signaling phase (&#x02a7d;1 h) of STAT5 to be most predictive for survival decisions, which was determined &#x0223c;24 h later. Interestingly, an earlier study that investigated a compendium of signaling pathways and responses in TNF-, EGF- and insulin-treated HT-29 cells revealed similar results in the predictability of apoptosis-survival cell fate decisions by early signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Gaudet et al, 2005</xref>). The authors report that early signaling events between 5 and 90 min immediately downstream of the receptors were more predictive than 2&#x02013;8 h, presumably because information is forwarded to downstream transcriptional events. Thus, we hypothesize that as a general principle in apoptotic decisions, ligand concentrations translated into kinetic-encoded information of early signaling events downstream of receptors (&#x02a7d;1 h) can be predictive for survival decisions 24 h later.</p><p>We could show by experimental data and mathematical modeling that SOCS3 and CIS reduce the steady-state STAT5 phosphorylation level after &#x0223c;1 h of stimulation. Our results at a single Epo concentration are consistent with other studies that investigated the regulation of STAT phosphorylation dynamics by SOCS proteins. As one example, SOCS3 that is induced upon IL-6 stimulation controls the late phosphorylation profile of STAT1 and STAT3 in the liver. This was shown in an experimental study using a conditional SOCS3 knockout, which resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of STATs, although the amplitude was unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Croker et al, 2003</xref>). The importance for adjusting the steady-state phase of transcription factor activity by transcriptional feedback regulators was shown also for other signaling pathways. EGF-induced ERK signaling in HeLa cells is increased 1 h after stimulation when translation is blocked by cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Amit et al, 2007</xref>). This temporal regulation pattern, including short-term deactivation by constitutively expressed phosphatases and late-phase modulation by slow transcriptional feedbacks may evolve as a general paradigm for tightly controlled cytokine-induced signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Legewie et al, 2008</xref>). The existence of multiple overlapping feedback regulation mechanisms, each with distinct temporal characteristics, ensures the effective control of the signaling dynamics to appropriately fine-tune cellular responses.</p><p>The fact that one or two SOCS family members are induced upon stimulation appears to be a general principle in cytokine-induced signaling, although there is no simple relationship between a particular cytokine and the pattern of respectively induced SOCS mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Krebs and Hilton, 2001</xref>). Induced in a cell type-specific and cytokine-dependent manner, SOCS proteins can distinctively coordinate cytokine-induced responses. A prime example for the evidence that two SOCS proteins uniquely attenuate STAT dynamics is the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">Wormald et al (2006)</xref> showing that SOCS1 and SOCS3 regulate STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation dynamics with different kinetics. Yet, the impact of different ligand concentrations has not been considered so far. By using model simulations to analyze the inhibitory effects of CIS and SOCS3 on the STAT5 phosphorylation level at previously unobserved Epo concentrations, our results revealed that the two feedbacks are most effective at different Epo concentration ranges. Conventional experimental techniques, however, cannot resolve the entire dynamic range of ligand concentrations. According to our mathematical model, the major role of CIS is modulating STAT5 phosphorylation levels at low, basal Epo concentrations, whereas SOCS3 is essential to control the STAT5 phosphorylation levels at high Epo doses.</p><p>As potential molecular mechanism of this dose-dependent inhibitory effect, we could identify the quantity of pJAK2 relative to pEpoR that increases with higher Epo concentrations. Since SOCS3 can inhibit JAK2 directly via its KIR domain to attenuate downstream STAT5 activation, SOCS3 becomes more effective with the relative increase of JAK2 activation. These observations are further supported by the CIS and SOCS3 overexpression experiments that showed the strong inhibition of JAK2 phosphorylation only by SOCS3 in primary CFU-E cells. Moreover, in cells overexpressing SOCS3 the STAT5 phosphorylation level was more extensively reduced and survival was more decreased than in CIS overexpressing cells considering similar overexpression levels.</p><p>Our findings raise the question why it is important for the cell to tightly control the long-term steady-state signaling level of STAT5 by transcriptional feedback regulators over the entire range of high and low Epo doses although the first hour of STAT5 activation is predictive for the survival decision. We hypothesize that when the decision for survival has occurred, it is essential to constrain signaling to a residual steady-state level in order to prevent aberrant events that could lead to uncontrolled erythroid progenitor growth. Constitutive phosphorylation of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway caused by activating JAK2 mutations has a crucial role in the onset of polycythemia vera (PV), a disease that is characterized by the formation of endogenous colonies with Epo-independent differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Prchal and Axelrad, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Weinberg et al, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Kota et al, 2008</xref>). Moreover, human erythroid progenitor cells transduced with a constitutive phosphorylated form of STAT5 were reported to survive, proliferate and differentiate in the absence of Epo and in this way mimic the PV phenotype. The essential requirement for progenitor cells to tightly constrict the Epo input signal after 1 h of stimulation over the broad range of physiological Epo concentrations that can vary over 1000-fold is already apparent at the upstream receptor level. Different studies have shown that activation of EpoR and JAK2 is rapidly terminated within the first hour by dephosphorylation as well as internalization and degradation of Epo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Gross and Lodish, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Becker et al, 2010</xref>).</p><p>We propose that the transcriptional feedback proteins CIS and SOCS3 are required to tightly adjust the phosphorylation level of STAT5 after 1 h of stimulation. This hypothesis is supported by reports demonstrating the crucial role of SOCS3 in embryonic development. Mice lacking the <italic>SOCS3</italic> gene exhibit embryonic lethality at days E12&#x02013;16. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Marine et al (1999)</xref> showed that these mice display erythrocytosis with dramatic expansion of erythropoiesis within the fetal liver as well as throughout the embryo. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Roberts et al (2001)</xref> demonstrated that the death is associated with abnormalities in the placenta. Vice versa, enforced expression of SOCS3 <italic>in vivo</italic> specifically suppressed fetal liver erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Marine et al, 1999</xref>). Moreover, a loss-of-function mutation of SOCS3 has been proposed to contribute to the onset of myeloproliferative disease in PV patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Suessmuth et al, 2009</xref>). In cancer, high input doses are mimicked by aberrant activation of JAKs that are frequently mutated in many tumor cells. Interestingly, there are numerous recent studies showing that in several malignant tumors JAK activating mutations are complemented by gene silencing of SOCS3 and SOCS1, the two SOCS members which contain a KIR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">He et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Chim et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Johan et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Jost et al, 2007</xref>). This underlines the essential role of SOCS3 to control high input doses. Thus, the absence of SOCS3 severely impacts the growth and survival of erythroid progenitor cells and is essential to abrogate signaling downstream of the EpoR at long-term steady-state phosphorylation levels upon high upstream input conditions.</p><p>In contrast to SOCS3, our model predicts that CIS acts most efficiently at a single point of the network at low ligand concentrations. This is line with other reports that demonstrated the major role of CIS as a specific competitive binding inhibitor of STAT5 at the pY401 position of the EpoR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Matsumoto et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Verdier et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Ketteler et al, 2002</xref>). The specific inhibition of STAT5-mediated responses by CIS is also supported by transgenic mice that overexpress CIS. These animals display diminished expression of STAT5-mediated responses in growth hormone and prolactin signaling, similar to STAT5<sup>&#x00394;N/&#x00394;N</sup> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Matsumoto et al, 1999</xref>). In contrast to SOCS3 knockout mice, CIS knockout mice are viable, but show an increase in hematopoietic progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Kubo et al, 2003</xref>), which is in line with our model prediction of CIS as modulator of fine-tuned pSTAT5 responses at basal level Epo input.</p><p>In summary, our mathematical approach provided new insights into the specific function of feedback regulation in STAT5-mediated life or death decisions of primary erythroid cells. We dissected the roles of the transcriptionally induced proteins CIS and SOCS3 that operate as dual feedback with divided function thereby facilitating the control of STAT5 activation levels over the entire range of physiological Epo concentrations. The detailed understanding of the molecular processes and control distribution of Epo-induced JAK/STAT signaling can be further applied to gain insights into alterations promoting malignant hematopoietic diseases.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Isolation of TER119<sup>&#x02212;</sup> erythroid progenitor cells at the CFU-E stage from murine fetal livers</title><p>At E13.5 Balb/c mouse embryos were dissected from the uterus of killed females.

The solver was compiled as C-executable for MATLAB together with ODE equations. The ODE system was evaluated for 24 different experimental conditions. For numerical efficiency, these 24 independent calculations of the ODE system were parallelized. Including all experimental settings the model consisted of 115 unknown parameters. Kinetic parameters depending on unknown concentration scales have been disentangled from the respective scaling parameters by suitable transformations (as described in the Supplement). This facilitates a more efficient estimation of the unknown scaling factors. In the case of mRNA measurements of CIS and SOCS3, no experimental information was available about the absolute concentrations. Taking into consideration the independence of the kinetic parameters from the scaling parameters due to the applied parameter transformations, the internal scale of these two mRNA components was fixed to one. Consequently, the model cannot provide predictions of absolute mRNA concentration. For the absolute concentration of the EpoR_JAK complex, a literature value was included as prior information for concentration scale of the receptor complex.</p><p>The model parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood estimation taking into account a total of 541 data points. To allow for global parameter estimates, we scanned the parameter space, beginning from reasonable initial guesses by taking into account the time scale of the measurements, over orders of magnitude along the profile likelihood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Raue et al, 2009</xref>). For each step in the calculation of the profile likelihood, we applied the MATLAB implementation of the trust-region method (lsqnonlin) with user supplied derivatives. For the calculation of the derivatives, the sensitivity equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Leis and Kramer, 1988</xref>) were simultaneously solved together with the original ODE systems, which is featured by the CVODES solver efficiently. To improve convergence of the estimation and due to the positive definite nature of the parameters such as rate constant, initial concentrations, concentration offsets and scales, and noise magnitudes, the parameters were estimated in logarithmic parameter space. In order to provide for normally distributed measurement noise the likelihood was evaluated in logarithmic concentration space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Kreutz et al, 2007</xref>) transforming the mainly multiplicative nature of the noise to an additive one. The magnitude of the additive measurement noise was estimated simultaneously. For each experimental technique and, in the case of immunoblotting, for each detection antibody utilized, an individual noise parameter is included in the model. The calculations of the profile likelihood suggest that the global optimum has been found.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d32e26" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Supplementary Figures S1&#x02013;61, Supplementary Tables S1&#x02013;20</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201150-s1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e32" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Model</title><p>SBML Model File</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201150-s2.xml" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="xml"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e38" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Review Process File</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201150-s3.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Sandra Manthey, Susen Lattermann and Maria Saile for excellent technical assistance; Nao Iwamoto and Verena Becker for helpful discussions.

Dashed-dotted lines indicate delayed reactions used for RNA transcription. Prefix &#x02018;p' represents phosphorylated species and &#x02018;n' represents nuclear species. Binding of the ligand Epo to its cognate receptor results in phosphorylation of JAK2, which becomes activated. In a second step, EpoR is phosphorylated in the complex EpoRpJAK2. The pEpoRpJAK2 complex was modeled by considering different subclasses of phosphorylated tyrosines at the receptor (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Material Section 2.2</xref>). STAT5 is recruited by pEpoR and phosphorylated by pJAK2, dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus. As target genes of STAT5, the negative feedback proteins CIS and SOCS3 are expressed, which inhibit the pathway.
