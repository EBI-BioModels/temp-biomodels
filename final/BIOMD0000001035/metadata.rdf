Abstract:
Virotherapy is a therapeutic treatment for cancer. It uses genetically engineered viruses to selectively infect, replicate in, and destroy cancer cells without damaging normal cells. In this paper, we present a modified model to include, within the dynamics of virotherapy, the interaction between uninfected tumor cells and immune response. The model is analyzed qualitatively to produce five equilibrium points. One of these equilibriums demonstrates the effect observed in virotherapy, where the immune system demolishes infected cells as well as viruses. Moreover, the existence and stability of the equilibrium points are established under certain criteria. Numerical simulations are performed to display the agreement with the analytical results. Finally, parameter analysis is carried out to illustrate which parameters in the model affect the outcome of virotherapy.</pre>
