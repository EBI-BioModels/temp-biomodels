    <p>Simplified (3-variable) calcium oscillation model Kummer et
  al. (2000) Biophys. J. 79, 1188-1195 This model is defined in a
  small compartment with low concentrations. You can run it first
  with the LSODA ODE solver and then with the Gillespie Monte Carlo
  method (in Time Course widget). This illustrates that at low
  particle numbers, as here, the stochastic simulation and the ODE
  approach produce different results (the stochastic approach is
  more correct in these circumstances). This file also demonstrates
  the use of several different plots to visualize results,
  including a histogram.</p>

    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>We present a new model for calcium oscillations based on
    experiments in hepatocytes. The model considers feedback
    inhibition on the initial agonist receptor complex by calcium
    and activated phospholipase C, as well as receptor
    type-dependent self-enhanced behavior of the activated G(alpha)
    subunit. It is able to show simple periodic oscillations and
    periodic bursting, and it is the first model to display chaotic
    bursting in response to agonist stimulations. Moreover, our
    model offers a possible explanation for the differences in
    dynamic behavior observed in response to different agonists in
    hepatocytes.</p>
