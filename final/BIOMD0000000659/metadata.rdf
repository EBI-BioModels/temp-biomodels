    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The skin is largely comprised of keratinocytes within the
    interfollicular epidermis. Over approximately two weeks these
    cells differentiate and traverse the thickness of the skin. The
    stage of differentiation is therefore reflected in the
    positions of cells within the tissue, providing a convenient
    axis along which to study the signaling events that occur in
    situ during keratinocyte terminal differentiation, over this
    extended two-week timescale. The canonical ERK-MAPK signaling
    cascade (Raf-1, MEK-1/2 and ERK-1/2) has been implicated in
    controlling diverse cellular behaviors, including proliferation
    and differentiation. While the molecular interactions involved
    in signal transduction through this cascade have been well
    characterized in cell culture experiments, our understanding of
    how this sequence of events unfolds to determine cell fate
    within a homeostatic tissue environment has not been fully
    characterized.We measured the abundance of total and
    phosphorylated ERK-MAPK signaling proteins within
    interfollicular keratinocytes in transverse cross-sections of
    human epidermis using immunofluorescence microscopy. To
    investigate these data we developed a mathematical model of the
    signaling cascade using a normalized-Hill differential equation
    formalism.These data show coordinated variation in the
    abundance of phosphorylated ERK-MAPK components across the
    epidermis. Statistical analysis of these data shows that
    associations between phosphorylated ERK-MAPK components which
    correspond to canonical molecular interactions are dependent
    upon spatial position within the epidermis. The model
    demonstrates that the spatial profile of activation for
    ERK-MAPK signaling components across the epidermis may be
    maintained in a cell-autonomous fashion by an underlying
    spatial gradient in calcium signaling.Our data demonstrate an
    extended phospho-protein profile of ERK-MAPK signaling cascade
    components across the epidermis in situ, and statistical
    associations in these data indicate canonical ERK-MAPK
    interactions underlie this spatial profile of ERK-MAPK
    activation. Using mathematical modelling we have demonstrated
    that spatially varying calcium signaling components across the
    epidermis may be sufficient to maintain the spatial profile of
    ERK-MAPK signaling cascade components in a cell-autonomous
    manner. These findings may have significant implications for
    the wide range of cancer drugs which therapeutically target
    ERK-MAPK signaling components.</p>
