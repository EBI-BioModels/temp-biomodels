    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>A possible therapeutic strategy for amyloid diseases
    involves the use of small molecule compounds to inhibit protein
    assembly into insoluble aggregates. According to the recently
    proposed Crystallization-Like Model, the kinetics of amyloid
    fibrillization can be retarded by decreasing the frequency of
    new fibril formation or by decreasing the elongation rate of
    existing fibrils. To the compounds that affect the nucleation
    and/or the growth steps we call true inhibitors. An apparent
    inhibition mechanism may however result from the alteration of
    thermodynamic properties such as the solubility of the
    amyloidogenic protein. Apparent inhibitors markedly influence
    protein aggregation kinetics measured in vitro, yet they are
    likely to lead to disappointing results when tested in vivo.
    This is because cells and tissues media are in general much
    more buffered against small variations in composition than the
    solutions prepared in lab. Here we show how to discriminate
    between true and apparent inhibition mechanisms from
    experimental data on protein aggregation kinetics. The goal is
    to be able to identify false positives much earlier during the
    drug development process.</p>
