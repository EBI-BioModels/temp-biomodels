    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Experimental and clinical data on purine metabolism are
    collated and analyzed with three mathematical models. The first
    model is the result of an attempt to construct a traditional
    kinetic model based on Michaelis-Menten rate laws. This attempt
    is only partially successful, since kinetic information, while
    extensive, is not complete, and since qualitative information
    is difficult to incorporate into this type of model. The data
    gaps necessitate the complementation of the Michaelis-Menten
    model with other functional forms that can incorporate
    different types of data. The most convenient and established
    representations for this purpose are rate laws formulated as
    power-law functions, and these are used to construct a
    Complemented Michaelis-Menten (CMM) model. The other two models
    are pure power-law-representations, one in the form of a
    Generalized Mass Action (GMA) system, and the other one in the
    form of an S-system. The first part of the paper contains a
    compendium of experimental data necessary for any model of
    purine metabolism. This is followed by the formulation of the
    three models and a comparative analysis. For physiological and
    moderately pathological perturbations in metabolites or
    enzymes, the results of the three models are very similar and
    consistent with clinical findings. This is an encouraging
    result since the three models have different structures and
    data requirements and are based on different mathematical
    assumptions. Significant enzyme deficiencies are not so well
    modeled by the S-system model. The CMM model captures the
    dynamics better, but judging by comparisons with clinical
    observations, the best model in this case is the GMA model. The
    model results are discussed in some detail, along with
    advantages and disadvantages of each modeling strategy.</p>
