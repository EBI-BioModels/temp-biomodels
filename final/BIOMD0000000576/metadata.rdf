    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>It is an accepted paradigm that extended stress predisposes
    an individual to pathophysiology. However, the biological
    adaptations to minimize this risk are poorly understood. Using
    a computational model based upon realistic kinetic parameters
    we are able to reproduce the interaction of the stress hormone
    cortisol with its two nuclear receptors, the high-affinity
    glucocorticoid receptor and the low-affinity pregnane
    X-receptor. We demonstrate that regulatory signals between
    these two nuclear receptors are necessary to optimize the
    body&apos;s response to stress episodes, attenuating both the
    magnitude and duration of the biological response. In addition,
    we predict that the activation of pregnane X-receptor by
    multiple, low-affinity endobiotic ligands is necessary for the
    significant pregnane X-receptor-mediated transcriptional
    response observed following stress episodes. This integration
    allows responses mediated through both the high and
    low-affinity nuclear receptors, which we predict is an
    important strategy to minimize the risk of disease from chronic
    stress.</p>
