    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The circadian clock is an endogenous timekeeper that allows
    organisms to anticipate and adapt to the daily variations of
    their environment. The plant clock is an intricate network of
    interlocked feedback loops, in which transcription factors
    regulate each other to generate oscillations with expression
    peaks at specific times of the day. Over the last decade,
    mathematical modeling approaches have been used to understand
    the inner workings of the clock in the model plant Arabidopsis
    thaliana. Those efforts have produced a number of models of
    ever increasing complexity. Here, we present an alternative
    model that combines a low number of equations and parameters,
    similar to the very earliest models, with the complex network
    structure found in more recent ones. This simple model
    describes the temporal evolution of the abundance of eight
    clock gene mRNA/protein and captures key features of the clock
    on a qualitative level, namely the entrained and free-running
    behaviors of the wild type clock, as well as the defects found
    in knockout mutants (such as altered free-running periods, lack
    of entrainment, or changes in the expression of other clock
    genes). Additionally, our model produces complex responses to
    various light cues, such as extreme photoperiods and non-24 h
    environmental cycles, and can describe the control of hypocotyl
    growth by the clock. Our model constitutes a useful tool to
    probe dynamical properties of the core clock as well as
    clock-dependent processes.</p>
