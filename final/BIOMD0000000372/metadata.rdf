  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
A mathematical model of the insulin-glucose feedback regulation in man is used
to examine the effects of an oscillatory supply of insulin compared to a
constant supply at the same average rate. We show that interactions between the
oscillatory insulin supply and the receptor dynamics can be of minute
significance only. It is possible, however, to interpret seemingly conflicting
results of clinical studies in terms of their different experimental conditions
with respect to the hepatic glucose release. If this release is operating near
an upper limit, an oscillatory insulin supply will be more efficient in lowering
the blood glucose level than a constant supply. If the insulin level is high
enough for the hepatic release of glucose to nearly vanish, the opposite effect
is observed. For insulin concentrations close to the point of inflection of the
insulin-glucose dose-response curve an oscillatory and a constant insulin
infusion produce similar effects. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.
