  <p align="left">The model reproduces Figures 4,5 and 6 of the publication. The analytical functions for cometabolites Catp, Camp, Cnadph,  and Cnadp slightly differ from the equations given in the paper. These changes were made in consultation with Dr. Christophe Chassagnole and are essential for reproducing the figures.  The dependency of the rate of change of extracellular glucose concentration on the ratio of biomass concentration to specific weight of biomass (Cx*rPTS/Rhox) is taken into account by appropriately adjusting the stoichiometries of the species involved in the phosphotransferase system  (rPTS). The rmax values for the various reactions are obtained from experiments and are not provided in the paper. However, these were personally communicated to the JWS repository. The model has been successfully tested on MathSBML.</p>
