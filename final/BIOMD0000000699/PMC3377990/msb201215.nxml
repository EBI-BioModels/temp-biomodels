In budding yeast, a surveillance mechanism called the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) prevents exit from mitosis when the mitotic spindle fails to align along the mother-to-daughter polarity axis. SPOC arrest relies upon inhibition of the GTPase Tem1 by the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) complex Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2. Importantly, reactions signaling mitotic exit take place at yeast centrosomes (named spindle pole bodies, SPBs) and the GAP complex also promotes SPB localization of Tem1. Yet, whether the regulation of Tem1 by Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 takes place only at the SPBs remains elusive. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 and Tem1 localization at the SPBs. Based on the measured SPB-bound protein levels, we introduce a dynamical model of the SPOC that describes the regulation of Bfa1 and Tem1. Our model suggests that Bfa1 interacts with Tem1 in the cytoplasm as well as at the SPBs to provide efficient Tem1 inhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bfa1</kwd><kwd>mitotic exit network</kwd><kwd>modeling and simulation</kwd><kwd>spindle position checkpoint</kwd><kwd>Tem1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In many eukaryotic cells, the mitotic spindle dictates the site of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Straight and Field, 2000</xref>). However in budding yeast, the site of cytokinesis (bud neck) is determined early in the cell cycle independently of the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Pruyne and Bretscher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Casamayor and Snyder, 2002</xref>). Therefore, to preserve the fidelity of chromosome segregation, budding yeast's mitotic spindle must elongate along the mother-to-daughter cell polarity axis, moving one set of chromosomes through the bud neck into the daughter cell compartment (also named as &#x02018;bud'). Two functionally redundant microtubule-associated pathways, namely Kar9- and dynein-dependent pathways, orientate the spindle with respect to the cell polarity axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Siller and Doe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Moore and Cooper, 2010</xref>). If the spindle fails to align properly, a surveillance mechanism called the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) prevents cells from exiting mitosis until correct spindle orientation is achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Caydasi et al, 2010a</xref>).</p><p>Mitotic exit in budding yeast is driven by a signal transduction cascade called the mitotic exit network (MEN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Jaspersen et al, 1998</xref>). Activation of the small GTPase Tem1 is the most upstream event in the initiation of MEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Lee et al, 2001</xref>). Yet, Tem1 activation is not well understood. For many years, the Lte1 protein was postulated to function as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) of Tem1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Shirayama et al, 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">1994b</xref>). However, this view was recently disproved and so far a GEF for Tem1 has not been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">Yoshida et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Geymonat et al, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bertazzi et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Falk et al, 2011</xref>). Inactivation of Tem1 occurs via acceleration of Tem1 GTP hydrolysis by the Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Geymonat et al, 2002</xref>). Bfa1 and Bub2 are essential components of the SPOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Fesquet et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Fraschini et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Li, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Pereira et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">Wang et al, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The activity of the Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 GAP complex is kept under tight control. In cells with correctly aligned spindles, the polo-like kinase Cdc5 inactivates the GAP complex by phosphorylating Bfa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Gruneberg et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Hu et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Geymonat et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Park et al, 2004</xref>). However, upon spindle misalignment, the kinase Kin4 phosphorylates Bfa1, preventing its inhibitory phosphorylation by Cdc5. Kin4 is therefore crucial for maintaining the GAP complex active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">D'Aquino et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Maekawa et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>The yeast centrosomes (named spindle pole bodies, SPBs) have a critical role in the regulation of mitotic exit. Association of Tem1 with SPBs is indispensable for MEN activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Gruneberg et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>). Active Tem1 at the SPBs promotes SPB binding of its effector kinase Cdc15, which in turn is required for activation and SPB localization of the downstream kinase Dbf2 in complex with its regulatory subunit Mob1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Cenamor et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Asakawa et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Visintin and Amon, 2001</xref>). The SPB also plays a key role in SPOC regulation. Inhibition of the GAP complex by Cdc5 occurs at the SPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Maekawa et al, 2007</xref>). During an unperturbed mitosis, Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 and Tem1 preferentially bind to the SPB that moves into the daughter cell (dSPB, daughter SPB), whereas during spindle misalignment they associate equally with both SPBs albeit at reduced levels compared with cells with correctly aligned spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Pereira et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Molk et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). This localization change is a consequence of the phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Kin4, which destabilizes the binding of Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 GAP complex to the SPBs, and seems to be crucial for the checkpoint activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>). Although Tem1 SPB binding is highly dynamic irrespective of the spindle orientation status, Tem1 levels at the SPBs also decrease during spindle misalignment because Tem1 SPB association mainly occurs via its interaction with the GAP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Molk et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>). However, a small pool of Tem1 can bind more stably to the SPBs in a GAP-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Pereira et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>). The physiological significance and regulation of this pool is not yet understood.</p><p>It is clear that inhibition of the MEN in response to spindle misalignment involves an intricate regulatory network that controls Tem1 localization and GTP hydrolysis by Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 GAP complex; in addition to Bfa1 localization and phosphorylation by Kin4 and Cdc5 kinases. Quantitative analysis and mathematical modeling are important tools that help to elucidate how such elaborate systems might work. So far, mathematical models have helped to enlighten some mitotic control mechanisms; however, no modeling has been done for SPOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chen et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Doncic et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Toth et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Lohel et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Lopez-Aviles et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Simonetta et al, 2009</xref>). One of the reasons for this is the lack of quantitative data on SPOC, which is restricted to <italic>in-vitro</italic> assays of Tem1 (nucleotide-binding properties and GTPase activity) in addition to microscopy studies of Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 and Tem1 (SPB-binding dynamics) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Geymonat et al, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Molk et al, 2004</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>). Here, we employed a fluorescence microscopy based strategy to quantify the number of Bfa1, Bub2 and Tem1 molecules associated with the SPBs. By combining protein numbers with quantitative time-lapse data, we assessed the amounts of GAP-dependent and -independent Tem1 pools at the SPBs and showed that they coexist during mitosis. These quantitative studies served as a basis to construct a compartmentalized dynamical model of the SPOC. Our model points out the importance of cytoplasmic Bfa1&#x02013;Tem1 interactions for robust inhibition of Tem1 in response to spindle misalignment and it highlights the contribution of Cdc5-independent Bfa1 inhibitory mechanisms to allow rapid Tem1 activation upon spindle realignment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Quantification of the number of Bfa1, Bub2 and Tem1 molecules at the SPBs</title><p>To estimate the levels of Bfa1, Bub2 and Tem1 at the SPBs during anaphase, we employed a fluorescence ratio method that uses GFP-tagged structural kinetochore proteins as reference standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Joglekar et al, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2008</xref>). It was established that in anaphase &#x0223c;352 molecules of Nuf2&#x02013;GFP, 352 molecules of Ndc80&#x02013;GFP and 83 molecules of Cse4&#x02013;GFP are present at each kinetochore cluster, which consists of 16 kinetochores clustered in the vicinity of each SPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Coffman et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Lawrimore et al, 2011</xref>). The experimental set up was implemented in our strain background, using Nuf2&#x02013;GFP as a reference to calculate the relative fluorescence intensity of each protein of interest (POI). Importantly, the mean fluorescence intensities of Cse4&#x02013;GFP, Ndc80&#x02013;GFP and an integrated signal of Nuf2&#x02013;GFP and Ndc80&#x02013;GFP linearly correlated with the known number of molecules at the kinetochores, validating the accuracy of our measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>We next measured the mean fluorescence intensities of Bfa1&#x02013;GFP, Bub2&#x02013;GFP and Tem1&#x02013;GFP at the SPBs of anaphase cells in a <italic>kar9</italic>&#x00394; background. <italic>KAR9</italic> deleted cells frequently misalign their anaphase spindle, hence allowing for the capture of both normal- and mis-oriented spindles in the same strain background. Signal intensities at the daughter and the mother SPBs (dSPB and mSPB, respectively) were computed separately for cells with normally aligned spindles. In the case of spindle misalignment, measurements of dSPB and mSPB were combined (any SPB) because the signal intensities at the two SPBs were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). SPB-bound Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 and Tem1 levels are not constant during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Molk et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed a relatively high fluorescence intensity variation within Bfa1&#x02013;GFP, Bub2&#x02013;GFP and Tem1&#x02013;GFP sample populations (coefficient of variation&#x0003e;47&#x00025;) compared with the Nuf2&#x02013;GFP signal distribution (coefficient of variation &#x0003c;25&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). We also compared the total cellular levels of Bfa1&#x02013;GFP, Bub2&#x02013;GFP and Tem1&#x02013;GFP by measuring their whole-cell mean fluorescence intensities during anaphase. We found that Bfa1 and Bub2 had similar total cellular amounts, whereas Tem1 was 2.5-fold higher than Bfa1 or Bub2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Based on Nuf2&#x02013;GFP, we calculated the number of Bfa1&#x02013;GFP, Bub2&#x02013;GFP and Tem1&#x02013;GFP molecules at SPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). When comparing the average SPB-bound amounts of Bfa1 and Bub2 in cells with normal aligned anaphase spindles, we observed an asymmetric index (ratio of dSPB- to mSPB-associated protein) of 5&#x02013;6. In the case of spindle misalignment, mean Bfa1 and Bub2 numbers at both SPBs were similar to the levels observed at the mSPB during a normal anaphase. The same was true for Tem1. However, in comparison to Bfa1 and Bub2, higher levels of Tem1 were detected at the mSPB and SPBs of cells with misaligned spindles. Furthermore, although the majority of Tem1 is targeted to the SPBs via the GAP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Pereira et al, 2000</xref>), the asymmetric index observed for Tem1 during normal anaphase was only 2.3 compared with 5&#x02013;6 for Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2. Thus, the binding of Tem1 to daughter and mother SPBs differs from Bfa1 and Bub2 in anaphase.</p><p>We next compared the SPB localization of Bfa1 and Tem1 throughout mitosis by time-lapse microscopy of cells simultaneously expressing <italic>TEM1&#x02013;GFP</italic> and <italic>BFA1&#x02013;3mCherry</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Along with the mean fluorescence intensities at the SPBs, distances between the SPBs (pole-to-pole distances) were measured as a reference for spindle elongation and hence cell-cycle progression. As previously shown for Bfa1&#x02013;GFP, Bfa1&#x02013;3mCherry levels increased at the dSPB and decreased at the mSPB during early anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>). Tem1&#x02013;GFP also increased at the dSPB similar to Bfa1, but did not drastically change at the mSPB. After the spindle reached 7&#x02009;&#x003bc;m in length, a sharp drop was observed for dSPB-bound Bfa1, whereas the decline of Tem1 at the dSPB was rather slow. Importantly, time-lapse analysis of cells carrying Bfa1&#x02013;3mCherry and Bub2&#x02013;GFP revealed that the SPB localization profile of Bub2&#x02013;GFP was similar to that of Bfa1&#x02013;3mCherry during mitosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>While the vast majority of Tem1 binds to the SPBs via the GAP complex, there is a small pool of Tem1 that binds to both SPBs (in a symmetric manner) in the absence of Bfa1 or Bub2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Pereira et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>). We refer to this fraction of Tem1 as the &#x02018;GAP-independent pool'. We reasoned that this pool might be responsible for the differences between Tem1 and Bfa1 SPB localization profiles during mitosis. Using <italic>TEM1&#x02013;GFP bfa1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; cells, we determined the average number of GAP-independent Tem1 molecules at the SPBs in early (spindle &#x0003c;4&#x02009;&#x003bc;m) and late anaphase (spindle &#x0003e;4&#x02009;&#x003bc;m). Because mSPB and dSPB bind equal amount of Tem1, we combined the measurements of both SPBs (represented as &#x02018;any SPB'; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). In concordance with previous reports, the GAP-independent Tem1 pool was relatively small and the amounts were significantly less in early than in the late anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Pereira et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>). Time-lapse analysis of Tem1&#x02013;GFP in <italic>bfa1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; cells confirmed that the GAP-independent Tem1 levels did not change significantly from metaphase until mid-anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>). Only after the anaphase spindle reached a length of 6&#x02013;7&#x02009;&#x003bc;m, the increase of Tem1 at both SPBs became pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, in <italic>bfa1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; cells, maximum levels of Tem1 at the SPBs were observed after spindle collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). These data thus suggest that the maximum level of GAP-independent Tem1 at the SPBs is reached after mitotic exit.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GAP-dependent and GAP-independent pools of Tem1 coexist at the SPBs</title><p>We next asked whether two Tem1-binding sites (GAP-dependent and GAP-independent) coexist at the SPBs in cells expressing <italic>BFA1</italic> and <italic>BUB2</italic>. This was particularly important because the presence of the Tem1 GAP-independent pool at SPBs was so far based on the analysis of <italic>bfa1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; cells. However, whether this GAP-independent binding site would also contribute to Tem1 SPB localization in the presence of Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 was not analyzed. We postulated that if Tem1 associates with two binding sites at SPBs, the SPB-binding profile of Tem1 in wild-type (WT) cells should represent the sum of the GAP-dependent and -independent pools. If this were true, subtracting the GAP-independent pool of Tem1 from the total SPB-associated Tem1 pool should give rise to a SPB-binding profile closer to the one observed for Bfa1 and/or Bub2. To test this hypothesis, we converted the SPB-associated fluorescence intensities obtained from the time-lapse analysis of <italic>TEM1&#x02013;GFP BFA1&#x02013;3mCherry</italic> and <italic>TEM1&#x02013;GFP Spc42&#x02013;eqFP bfa1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B and D</xref>) into protein numbers by scaling the curves in the <italic>y</italic>-axis according to the average number of molecules presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). This conversion allowed comparison of protein levels among different fluorophores and time lapses. By subtracting the scaled Tem1 time-lapse curve of <italic>bfa1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; cells from that of WT cells, we obtained a hypothetical time-lapse curve for the number of Tem1 molecules recruited to SPBs in a GAP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>, upper panel). Interestingly, this GAP-dependent curve for Tem1 displayed the same profile of the Bfa1 curve, as its ratio to Bfa1 remained relatively constant over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>, lower panel). Collectively, our data indicate that GAP-dependent and -independent pools of Tem1 coexist at the SPBs of WT cells throughout mitosis and the difference in SPB localization of Tem1 and Bfa1 results from the Tem1 GAP-independent pool.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>SPB-bound Tem1 levels sufficient for MEN activation</title><p>Taking into account that complete depletion of Tem1 from the SPBs prevents MEN activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Gruneberg et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>), we sought to determine the number of SPB-bound active Tem1 molecules that would be sufficient for MEN activation.

In the absence of Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2, Mob1 prematurely localized to both SPBs during metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Pereira et al, 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). However, in both WT and <italic>bfa1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; cells, Mob1 levels peaked at the SPBs when the spindle was 6&#x02013;7&#x02009;&#x003bc;m in length, which was 7&#x02013;8&#x02009;min before its accumulation at the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly in <italic>bfa1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; cells, when Mob1 reached its highest levels at the SPBs, SPB-bound Tem1 numbers were still low (75 molecules; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B and D</xref>, right panels, note the dashed gray lines as landmarks) and the maximum levels of SPB-bound Tem1 were reached only after Mob1 had accumulated at the bud neck (i.e., after mitotic exit). We therefore concluded that 75 Tem1 molecules at the SPBs are sufficient to promote Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 activation in the absence of the GAP complex.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A dynamical model of the SPOC</title><p>To analyze the systemic capability of the SPOC to inhibit Tem1 at the SPBs, we developed a dynamical model of the SPOC focusing on the regulation of Tem1 by the GAP complex Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 according to the wiring diagram outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>. Details can be found in Materials and methods and in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>. We considered the regulation of Bfa1 to model Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 GAP activity because Bfa1 is the regulatory subunit of the GAP complex and its regulation is better understood. We designed our model such that it could reproduce the binding pattern of Bfa1 and Tem1 at the dSPB in both situations, when the SPOC is active, and when it is inactive. To this end, we distinguished between molecules at the dSPB and molecules in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>), allowing them to exchange with kinetics compatible with previous FRAP analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>). We considered that Tem1 associates with the SPBs in a GAP-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>) and -independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Into this framework, we incorporated a reduced model of the intrinsic GTPase-cycle of Tem1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>) together with the acceleration of GTP hydrolysis by the Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 GAP complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Geymonat et al, 2002</xref>). We accounted for Bfa1 regulation through counteracting phosphorylation by Cdc5 and Kin4. Kin4 is essential for the activation of the SPOC in response to spindle misalignment; hence we used Kin4 to switch between active and inactive SPOC by allowing or disallowing it to phosphorylate Bfa1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>An important question we wanted to address <italic>in silico</italic> was whether the GAP inhibits Tem1 solely at the SPBs or also in the cytosol. Therefore, we modeled both possibilities under two model variants, named as &#x02018;hot-spot-association' and &#x02018;ubiquitous-association' models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>). In the hot-spot-association variant, binding of Bfa1 and Tem1 takes place exclusively at the SPB. This restriction was removed in the &#x02018;ubiquitous-association model, allowing for cytosolic association of Bfa1 and Tem1 (reactions marked with encircled &#x02018;C' in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, because it is unclear whether the GAP complex containing unphosphorylated Bfa1 (Bfa1 which is neither phosphorylated by Cdc5 nor by Kin4) is active or inactive <italic>in vivo</italic>, we made another model variant, namely the &#x02018;ubiquitous-inactive' variant, to investigate the effect of the activity of unphosphorylated Bfa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>). The &#x02018;ubiquitous-inactive' variant considers unphosphorylated Bfa1 to be inactive or inhibited.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Model simulation and analysis</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, Bfa1 and Tem1 levels rapidly decreased at the SPBs upon spindle misalignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>, shaded area), whereas they accumulated at the dSPB concomitantly with the establishment of correct spindle alignment during anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>, after shaded area). To reproduce such behavior <italic>in silico</italic>, we simulated an arbitrary time period of 60&#x02009;min in total, starting from an early anaphase state with a misaligned spindle (phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Kin4 switched on). After 30&#x02009;min, we consider the spindle to align correctly and turn off the SPOC (phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Kin4 switched off) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). The model output shows the levels of Bfa1 and Tem1 in their respective active and inactive states at the SPBs and in the cytosol.</p><p>To evaluate the ability of the model variants to regulate Tem1 activity in response to spindle alignment status, we defined a so-called &#x02018;threshold' for the SPB-bound Tem1&#x02013;GTP level that is certainly sufficient for initiation of MEN signaling. The landmark was based on the aforementioned number of Tem1 molecules at the SPBs in <italic>bfa1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; cells (75 molecules) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). Through analysis of a mathematical model of the intrinsic Tem1 GTPase-cycle, we estimated that 86&#x00025; of the total Tem1 amount would be bound to GTP if no GAP were present (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>). We therefore set the threshold to 65 molecules (0.86 &#x000d7; 75) of Tem1&#x02013;GTP at the SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>, the horizontal dashed line in the plots of the Tem1 level at the SPB). Thus, 65 molecules of Tem1&#x02013;GTP served as a safe landmark for the SPB-bound Tem1&#x02013;GTP levels that is capable of triggering the MEN cascade and help us to discriminate between different model variants. Ideally, a model must maintain the level of Tem1&#x02013;GTP well below 65 molecules if the SPOC is active, and allow rapid recovery of Tem1&#x02013;GTP to the level of or above this threshold upon deactivation of the SPOC to initiate MEN signaling.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tem1 interacts with Bfa1 in the cytosol and at the SPBs</title><p>In the ubiquitous-association model in which Tem1 and Bfa1 can interact both at the SPB and in the cytosol, Bfa1 becomes rapidly activated and depleted from the SPB in response to spindle misalignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5Ai</xref>, orange areas). Tem1 level decreases at the SPB along with Bfa1 and at the same time inactive Tem1 predominates in the cytosol as well as at the SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5Ai</xref>, red areas). The amount of remaining GTP-bound Tem1 is well below 65 molecules at the SPB (horizontal dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>); hence we consider the inhibition of mitotic exit to be reliable. Because of the discrete and stochastic nature of chemical reactions, considerable intrinsic noise can be present if the molecule numbers are low. Thus, we employed a discrete stochastic simulation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Gillespie, 1976</xref>) to assess the robustness of the checkpoint response with respect to intrinsic noise. In fact, even when the intrinsic noise is considered, SPB-bound active Tem1 stays well below the threshold value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>t</italic>&#x0003c;30&#x02009;min). After spindle realignment, Bfa1 and Tem1 accumulate at the SPB and reach the desired levels. However, active Tem1 accumulates slowly, reaching the defined threshold at the SPB about 30&#x02009;min after spindle realignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>t</italic>&#x0003e;30&#x02009;min).</p><p>In the hot-spot-association model, which restricts Tem1&#x02013;Bfa1 association to the SPB, the dynamics of the total SPB-bound Bfa1 and Tem1 levels at the SPB are virtually the same as in the ubiquitous-association model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5Aii</xref>). The deterministic and stochastic simulations show that during spindle misalignment, the level of SPB-bound Tem1&#x02013;GTP cannot be reduced below the threshold sufficient to activate MEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5Aii</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>, <italic>t</italic>&#x0003c;30&#x02009;min). Thus, the ubiquitous-association model is insufficient to inhibit Tem1 upon checkpoint activation. On the other hand, active Tem1 accumulates rapidly at the SPB after spindle realignment, reaching about 84&#x00025; of the total SPB-bound Tem1, which is close to the theoretical limit of 86&#x00025; in the absence of the GAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5Aii</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>, <italic>t</italic>&#x0003e;30&#x02009;min).</p><p>We next tested the two models <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>BFA1</italic> overexpression <italic>in silico</italic> resulted in reduced Tem1 levels at the SPB in the ubiquitous-association model while Tem1 levels were elevated in the hot-spot-association model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). When we overexpressed <italic>BFA1 in vivo</italic>, SPB-bound Tem1 decreased in the majority of the cells supporting the ubiquitous-association model and excluding the hot-spot-association model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). Taken together, the ubiquitous-association model is able to reproduce the Tem1 SPB-binding behavior observed <italic>in vivo</italic> upon <italic>BFA1</italic> overexpression, as well as providing sufficient Tem1 inhibition during the checkpoint response. It is also worth mentioning that even if the Tem1&#x02013;GTP threshold were lower than 65 molecules, the ubiquitous-association model would be valid, while the hot-spot-association model would still fail to inhibit Tem1 upon SPOC activation. Thus, our <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis strongly suggests that cytoplasmic Bfa1&#x02013;Tem1 interactions are essential for SPOC proficiency.</p><p>The ubiquitous-association model provides sufficient Tem1 inhibition during spindle misalignment; however, the recovery of active Tem1 upon spindle realignment is rather slow. Slow recovery in the ubiquitous-association model is a consequence of the slow deactivation of cytosolic Bfa1 by Cdc5, which is limited by the turnover of Bfa1 at the SPBs. We thus resimulated the ubiquitous-association model, yet assuming that unphosphorylated Bfa1 is inactive or inactivated upon spindle realignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5Aiii</xref>). This new model variant, namely the ubiquitous-inactive model, exhibits the same strong Tem1 inhibition as the ubiquitous-association model. In addition, it shows rapid accumulation of active Tem1 at the SPB after spindle realignment, indicating that an additional Bfa1 inhibitor can significantly improve Tem1&#x02013;GTP recovery. The superior properties of this variant are also reflected in the stochastic simulations as the inhibition and the recovery of Tem1 are rapid and robust (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6C</xref>). Taken together, the ubiquitous-inactive model combines the reliable Tem1 inhibition from the ubiquitous-association model with rapid Tem1&#x02013;GTP recovery upon checkpoint deactivation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Robustness of the ubiquitous-association and ubiquitous-inactive models to perturbations of the GDP-dissociation rate</title><p>The ability of our models to regulate Tem1 activity is largely dependent on the GDP-dissociation rate coefficient of Tem1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>). To assess the robustness of the ubiquitous-association and ubiquitous-inactive models to perturbations of the GDP-dissociation rate, the ability of both models to inhibit Tem1 upon spindle misalignment (&#x02018;relative inhibition') and to activate Tem1 upon spindle realignment (&#x02018;relative recovery') are examined for a range of GDP-dissociation rate coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). In terms of relative inhibition, both models behave similarly and require a low GDP-dissociation rate coefficient to allow inhibition of Tem1 below the levels sufficient for MEN activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, red curves). In contrast, GDP-release must be significantly faster in the ubiquitous-association model to reach the same relative recovery as the ubiquitous-inactive model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, green curves). SPOC can only work reliably if both inhibition and recovery are sufficient. Thus, we combined the relative inhibition and recovery into the &#x02018;quality level', which is zero if at least one of the two criteria (relative inhibition and recovery) is not satisfied. The quality level can only be high if both relative inhibition and recovery are high. Importantly, the quality level of the ubiquitous-inactive model is higher and covers considerably wider range of GDP-dissociation rates than the ubiquitous-association model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>, dark blue curves).</p><p>For robust checkpoint response, a clear distinction between the checkpoint active and inactive states is desirable. As a measure of robustness, we computed the &#x02018;dynamic range' of the checkpoint response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>, light blue curves). The dynamic range shows how distinct the SPOC active and inactive states are in terms of SPB-bound active Tem1 amounts. Interestingly, the dynamic range of the ubiquitous-inactive model is identical or higher than the dynamic range of the ubiquitous-association model for all parameter values scanned. The maximum dynamic range of the ubiquitous-inactive model is reached near the maximal quality level of this model. In contrast, the maximum quality level of the ubiquitous-association model lies in a region of only moderate dynamic range. Importantly, quality level of the ubiquitous-inactive model is maximal for GDP-dissociation rate coefficients close to our estimated nominal value of 0.017&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (vertical solid lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). Collectively, our analysis shows that the ubiquitous-inactive model is more robust against perturbations of the Tem1 GDP-dissociation rate.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Spatial and temporal control of mitotic exit requires elaborate regulatory mechanisms involving differential phosphorylation and binding to subcellular compartments. Although it is simple to capture single component behavior, integration of all the behaviors in a global network has so far been missing. Here, we assembled the reactions related to the GAP (Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2) and the GTPase (Tem1) into a compartmentalized dynamical model of the SPOC. Our model captured the observed protein behavior and furthermore provided <italic>in-silico</italic> evidence that cytoplasmic regulation of Tem1 by the GAP complex is critical for robust checkpoint arrest. We therefore anticipate that, although SPOC and MEN proteins accumulate at the SPBs and this location is undoubtedly important for MEN signaling, contribution of the cytoplasmic pools to the regulation of SPOC and MEN components should not be underestimated.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>A quantitative approach to study SPOC</title><p>The lack of quantitative data and the goal of building a dynamical model of the SPOC led us to determine the amounts of SPOC components at the SPBs. We observed that Tem1 binding to the SPBs did not exactly follow the SPB binding of Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2. First, Tem1 was less asymmetric than Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 at the SPBs during normal spindle alignment. Second, there was more Tem1 than Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 at the SPBs when the anaphase spindle was misaligned. The latter was somehow surprising because Tem1 was thought to be reduced at the SPBs to the same extent as Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 during spindle misalignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bardin et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Pereira et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Molk et al, 2004</xref>). Our data suggested that the discrepancy between Tem1 and Bfa1 SPB-binding patterns might arise from the Tem1 pool that associates with the SPBs in a GAP-independent manner. Importantly, quantitative time-lapse analysis indicated that GAP-independent and GAP-dependent Tem1 pools coexist throughout mitosis in WT cells. This conclusion is also in concordance with the biphasic recovery curve obtained from the FRAP analysis of SPB-associated Tem1&#x02013;GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Molk et al, 2004</xref>). How Tem1 binds to the SPBs independently of the GAP complex and how this pool is regulated are currently not clear. Yet, the SPB outer plaque component Nud1, which serves as a scaffold protein for the GAP complex, is also likely to be the receptor for the Tem1 GAP-independent pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Gruneberg et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>).</p><p>One of the major difficulties in understanding when MEN is activated arises from the lack of an <italic>in-vivo</italic> tool to discriminate between Tem1&#x02013;GTP and Tem1&#x02013;GDP. In <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, antibodies raised against the GDP-bound form of the Tem1-homolog Spg1, allowed monitoring of the inactive Spg1 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Sohrmann et al, 1998</xref>). However, so far no reagents have been established to differentiate between active and inactive Tem1 species in budding yeast, and although Tem1 can be replaced by Spg1, the Spg1-antibodies failed to work in budding yeast (unpublished observation of GP). Our model was therefore designed to provide the ratio of GTP and GDP-bound Tem1. However, for the evaluation of the checkpoint proficiency in the model, it was essential to set a critical level of SPB-bound Tem1&#x02013;GTP sufficient for MEN activation. In the search for such a landmark, we looked for a situation where Tem1 levels at the SPBs were low and still mitotic exit occurred without a delay. <italic>bfa1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; cells were excellent candidates as they met those two criteria. Tem1 levels at the SPBs of <italic>bfa1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; cells (GAP-independent Tem1) were low during metaphase and increased through anaphase. Although this behavior was described before, it was unclear whether the increase happened before or after mitotic exit. Through careful analysis of fluorescence time-lapse data, we showed that the GAP-independent Tem1 was low until mid-anaphase, increased through telophase and reached a maximum after mitotic exit. Monitoring of Mob1&#x02013;GFP localization as a marker for cell-cycle progression led us to the conclusion that the threshold for Tem1 activation is already matched during metaphase&#x02013;early anaphase in these cells, strikingly when the SPB-bound Tem1 levels were still low. Indeed, this also reflected the precocious localization of Cdc15, Mob1 and Dbf2 to the SPBs and premature activation of the Dbf2 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Fesquet et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Pereira et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Visintin and Amon, 2001</xref>). However, it is likely that because Cdc15 and Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 SPB localization is also enhanced by Cdc5 and early anaphase released Cdc14, Mob1 increases at the SPBs of <italic>bfa1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; cells in a similar manner to WT cells, independently of Tem1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Jaspersen and Morgan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Konig et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Rock and Amon, 2011</xref>). As a consequence, in the absence of the GAP complex mitotic exit occurs in time, indicating that inhibition of Tem1 is not necessary in an unperturbed anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Fraschini et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Pereira et al, 2000</xref>). The importance of the increase in the GAP-independent SPB-bound pool of Tem1 is however still puzzling. Considering that its maximum levels are reached after mitotic exit, one can speculate that Tem1 might have another function at the SPBs after activation of MEN.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>SPOC model</title><p>The SPOC model captured the localization of Bfa1 and Tem1, and further allowed for analysis of the ratio of active and inactive GAP and GTPase amounts at the SPBs. Using the aforementioned Tem1&#x02013;GTP threshold as a marker together with the results of deterministic and stochastic simulations, we were able to infer on the SPOC proficiency <italic>in silico</italic>. Our model predicts two important phenomena about regulation of Tem1 and Bfa1. First, robust checkpoint arrest is only achieved if Tem1 inhibition takes place in the cytoplasm and at the SPBs. This was a consequence of the Tem1 pool that binds to the SPBs in a GAP-independent manner. This pool cannot be inhibited by the GAP if the association of the GAP and GTPase is restricted to the SPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>, left). However, Tem1 binds to the GAP-independent binding site with a certain turnover that allows for exchange between the cytosolic and the SPB-associated pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>). Therefore, when cytosolic GAP and GTPase association was allowed, the GAP-independent Tem1 pool could be inhibited by cytoplasmic GAP complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>, right). Cytoplasmic interaction of Bfa1 and Tem1 was also supported by an <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiment where high cellular levels of Bfa1 titrated Tem1 from the SPBs. Again, this experiment could be reproduced <italic>in silico</italic> only when the cytosolic Bfa1&#x02013;Tem1 interaction was considered.</p><p>Second, rapid activation of Tem1 upon spindle realignment <italic>in silico</italic> could be achieved when unphosphorylated Bfa1 (Bfa1 which is not phosphorylated by Kin4 or by Cdc5) was considered to be inactive or inactivated by additional mechanisms parallel to Cdc5. Cdc5-phosphorylated Bfa1 accumulates slowly in the cytoplasm during normal spindle alignment, as Cdc5 phosphorylates only the SPB-bound Bfa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Maekawa et al, 2007</xref>) and the turnover rate of Bfa1 at the SPB limits the amount released into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>). Therefore, unphosphorylated Bfa1 needs to be inhibited especially if the anaphase spindle is normally aligned. According to the previous reports, Bfa1-11A mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by Cdc5 is sufficient to provide SPOC arrest even in the absence of Kin4; suggesting that unphosphorylated Bfa1 is active if the spindle is misaligned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). However, the same mutant does not promote a mitotic arrest if the anaphase spindle is normally aligned; implying that unphosphorylated Bfa1 is not fully active in this case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Hu et al, 2001</xref>). Thus, it is possible that GAP complexes containing unphosphorylated Bfa1 need to be inactivated by yet unknown mechanisms whenever correct spindle alignment is achieved. In fact, there is evidence that one of the effectors of Cdc42, Gic1/2, inhibits the interaction of Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 with Tem1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Hofken and Schiebel, 2004</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that Gic1/2 inhibits Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 GAP activity towards Tem1 by preventing GAP&#x02013;GTPase interaction upon dSPB entrance into the bud. Alternatively, additional regulation might be at the level of Bub2 as it is also subject to phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Hu and Elledge, 2002</xref>). Thus, several regulatory layers might contribute to GAP inactivation in addition to the well-established Bfa1&#x02013;Cdc5 branch.</p><p>Previously, two possible mechanisms were suggested to explain how the GAP Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 might inhibit the GTPase Tem1 during spindle misalignment. One of them highlighted the importance of Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 redistribution from the SPBs into the cytoplasm where the GAP is kept away from its inhibitor Cdc5 and inactivates Tem1 in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>). The other mechanism focused on exclusion of Tem1 from the SPBs together with Bfa1 because Tem1 localization is mainly dependent on Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2; and Tem1 SPB localization is essential for mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Pereira et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>). These two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and probably both are important for inhibition of Tem1. Indeed, because SPB-bound Tem1 level is higher than the calculated threshold during spindle misalignment, removal of Tem1 from the SPBs cannot be the only way for blocking mitotic exit, but the activity of the GAP is required as well. Our dynamical SPOC model greatly supports the necessity of Tem1 inhibition in the cytoplasm as well as at the SPBs to achieve minimum levels of Tem1&#x02013;GTP at the SPBs.</p><p>We propose that SPOC translates the information about spindle orientation into Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 activity, which in turn transmits a &#x02018;WAIT'-signal throughout the cytosol. This mechanism might be analogous to the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>), which senses spindle attachment at individual kinetochores and broadcasts a nucleoplasmic &#x02018;WAIT'-signal from kinetochores until proper attachment is established. Modeling of SAC helped to pinpoint advantages and problems of putative regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Doncic et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Sear and Howard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Ibrahim et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Simonetta et al, 2009</xref>).

GDP-release is the most sensitive undetermined parameter in our model of the GTPase-cycle with respect to the steady-state Tem1&#x02013;GTP level, and similarly the fold-acceleration &#x003bb; is highly important for the inactivation of Tem1 in our SPOC models. Therefore, we simulate the models with GDP-release rate coefficients and fold accelerations in a range spanning five orders of magnitude as described in the &#x02018;Parameter scans' section below. From these scans we selected the fold-acceleration &#x003bb;=10<sup>3</sup>, such that a further increase would have only subtle influence on the dependency of all model variants on the GDP-release rate coefficient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>).

The rate coefficients for dephosphorylation of Bfa1 by unknown phosphatases can be interpreted as the inverse of the expected lifetime of the respective phosphorylated state. The lifetime of the Kin4-phosphorylated state was chosen such that the steady state is approached within the first 30&#x02009;min after SPOC deactivation. The lifetime of the Cdc5-phosphorylated state was set to a similar value if the SPOC is active; however, in checkpoint active state, the model is insensitive to this parameter because in this case phosphorylation through Kin4 prevents phosphorylation by Cdc5. In contrast, dephosphorylation of Cdc5 is turned off upon SPOC deactivation to allow for accumulation of this phosphoform during anaphase.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Parameter scans</title><p>We simulated the model variants deterministically as described above with the Tem1 GDP-dissociation rate coefficient and the fold-acceleration of GTP hydrolysis by the GAP varied in a wide range <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub><sup>D</sup>&#x02208;[10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>, 10<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>] and &#x003bb;&#x02208;[1, 10<sup>4</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>], respectively (see previous section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>).

The dynamic range complements the nonlinear quality level with a linear measure of robustness.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d32e26" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Supplementary figures S1-9, Supplementary tables S1-5</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201215-s1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201215-dfS1A.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><label>Source data for Figure S1A</label></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201215-dfS1C.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><label>Source data for Figure S1C</label></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201215-dfS2A.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><label>Source data for Figure S2A</label></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201215-dfS2C.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><label>Source data for Figure S2C</label></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201215-dfS3B.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><label>Source data for Figure S3B</label></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201215-dfS5C.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><label>Source data for Figure S5C</label></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201215-dfS5D.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><label>Source data for Figure S5D</label></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e53" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Review Process File</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201215-s2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge K Bloom for sharing unpublished data; M Geymonat and SG Sedgwick for providing original data; Elmar Schiebel, Victor Sourjik, Anton Khmelinskii, Franz Meitinger, Fouzia Ahmad and Peter Kreyssig for critically reading the manuscript; Pereira and Dittrich lab members for comments and discussions.

Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 promotes the full release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus into the cytoplasm. Fully released Cdc14 inactivates the mitotic cyclin/Cdk and reverses the Cdk-dependent phosphorylation of several Cdk substrates, hence providing mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Visintin et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Jaspersen et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Stegmeier and Amon, 2004</xref>).

Tem1 undergoes an intrinsic GTPase-cycle (bent arrows), resulting in a balance between Tem1 active (Tem1&#x02013;GTP) and inactive (Tem1&#x02013;GDP) states. The active GAP complex Bfa1&#x02013;Bub2 binds to Tem1 and shifts the balance effectively towards Tem1&#x02013;GDP. Tem1-association with the SPB can be compared with a vessel (&#x02018;cytosol') with two chambers connected by a narrow tube. The chambers represent the GAP-dependent (bottom) and GAP-independent (top) Tem1 pools. If association of Bfa1 and Tem1 is spatially restricted to the bottom chamber like in the hot-spot-association model (left), the balance is affected only locally due to the narrow passage to the cytosol. Because Bfa1 does not affect Tem1 in the top chamber, the balance there is the same as in the cytosol. If Bfa1 can additionally associate with Tem1 in the cytosol, which is the situation in the ubiquitous-association and ubiquitous-inactive models (right), the balance in the cytosol is affected, too. Because the inflow into this chamber is then dominated by inactive Tem1, the concentration in the small chamber shifts towards inactive Tem1 despite the absence of the GAP complex. The outflow of active Tem1 in turn hardly affects the cytosol due to the huge difference of the volumes.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201215-f7"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="t1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Bfa1, Bub2 and Tem1 number of molecules at the SPBs</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">Mean</th><th align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">s.d.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="t1-fn1">a</xref></th><th align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">CV<xref ref-type="fn" rid="t1-fn2">b</xref> (&#x00025;)</th><th align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">SPB:total<xref ref-type="fn" rid="t1-fn3">c</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td colspan="5" align="left" valign="top" charoff="50"><italic>Bfa1</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;Misalignment<xref ref-type="fn" rid="t1-fn4">d</xref></td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">50</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">32</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">64</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">0.04</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;Alignment, mSPB</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">57</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">39</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">68</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">0.04</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;Alignment, dSPB</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">287</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">96</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">34</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">0.21</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left" valign="top" charoff="50"><italic>Bub2</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;Misalignment<xref ref-type="fn" rid="t1-fn4">d</xref></td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">37</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">24</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">65</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">0.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;Alignment, mSPB</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">31</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">21</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">68</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;Alignment, dSPB</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">199</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">89</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">45</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">0.14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left" valign="top" charoff="50"><italic>Tem1</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;Misalignment<xref ref-type="fn" rid="t1-fn4">d</xref></td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">125</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">35</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">28</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">0.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;Alignment, mSPB</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">112</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">41</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">37</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">0.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;Alignment, dSPB</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">255</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">98</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">38</td><td align="char" valign="top" char="." charoff="50">0.07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;<italic>bfa1</italic>&#x00394;
