Source data for Figure 3D: Response of the wild-type (diamonds) and engineered (dashes) budding yeast cells to oleate induction. The time course of Pot1p protein level was measured in individual cells using flow cytometry in the wild-type strain with a Pot1p-GFP reporter and in the engineered strain with the same reporter under oleate growth conditions. Error bars represent standard error of means of Pot1p-GFP protein level from six independent replicates.time (h)	Wild-type, average	Engineered strain, average	Wild-type, standard error	Engineered strain, standard error0	2.815	2.908333	0.046886	0.0185141	3.953333	3.418333	0.06195	0.0382463	8.038333	6.063333	0.074091	0.1182284	9.441667	6.958333	0.079934	0.1081795	10.37833	7.835	0.047987	0.0873986	11.365	8.681667	0.113395	0.0864657	11.76333	9.306667	0.118565	0.0961488	12.45833	9.913333	0.083882	0.09796821	38.15833	46.14833	0.84213	0.685154
