Cytoplasmic protein-RNA assemblies termed stress granules are increasingly recognized to promote cellular survival under stress. Thus, they might represent tumor vulnerabilities that are currently poorly explored. The translation-inhibitory eIF2&#x003b1; kinases are established as main drivers of stress granule assembly. Using a systems approach, we identify the translation enhancers PI3K and MAPK/p38 as pro-stress-granule-kinases. They act through the metabolic master regulator mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) to promote stress granule assembly. When highly active, PI3K is the main driver of stress granules; however, the impact of p38 becomes apparent as PI3K activity declines. PI3K and p38 thus act in a hierarchical manner to drive mTORC1 activity and stress granule assembly. Of note, this signaling hierarchy is also present in human breast cancer tissue. Importantly, only the recognition of the PI3K-p38 hierarchy under stress enabled the discovery of p38&#x02019;s role in stress granule formation. In summary, we assign a new pro-survival function to the key oncogenic kinases PI3K and p38, as they hierarchically promote stress granule formation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="sp1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rosalind-Franklin-Fellowship of the University of Groningen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thedieck</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="sp2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BMBF e:Med initiative GlioPATH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">01ZX1402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Opitz</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Thedieck</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Navas</surname><given-names>P Razquin</given-names></name><name><surname>Sch&#x000e4;uble</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="sp3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BMBF e:Med initiative MAPTor-NET</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp3">031A426A/B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sers</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Thedieck</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="sp4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stichting TSC Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thedieck</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="sp5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp5">TH 1358/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thedieck</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="sp6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MESI-STRAT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sadik</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Opitz</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Sers</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Heiland</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Thedieck</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="sp7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union&#x02019;s Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp7">754688</award-id></award-group><award-group id="sp8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp8">01ZZ1803G</award-id></award-group><award-group id="sp9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stress granules are cytoplasmic RNA-protein assemblies, which in a dynamic, reversible process create a non-membranous compartment (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kedersha &#x00026; Anderson, 2007</xref>) that recruits mRNAs and signaling proteins under stress (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kedersha et al, 2013</xref>). Thus, stress granules serve as a stress-driven signaling hub (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kedersha et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Heberle et al, 2015</xref>), which buffers translation and promotes survival (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Arimoto et al, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Tsai &#x00026; Wei, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Thedieck et al, 2013</xref>). In recent years, stress granules have emerged as critical determinants of cancer cell survival. Stress granule components are often up-regulated in tumor cells and promote their survival under endogenous and therapeutic stresses (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Heberle et al, 2015</xref>). Stress granule assembly is initiated by a variety of stress signals that stall translation (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Heberle et al, 2015</xref>). The best known regulators of stress granule assembly are eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2&#x003b1; (eIF2&#x003b1;) kinases (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al, 2015</xref>), which inhibit eIF2&#x003b1; to reduce global cap-dependent translation (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Holcik, 2015</xref>). The subsequent release of monosomal mRNA bound to noncanonical preinitiation complexes enables the recruitment of RNA-binding proteins leading to stress granule formation (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Panas et al, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Next to eIF2&#x003b1; kinases, the serine&#x02013;threonine kinase mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) also has been suggested to impinge on stress granules, with opposite hypotheses on the mode of regulation. On the one hand, mTORC1 inhibition has been proposed to induce stress granules (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann et al, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Panas et al, 2016</xref>). mTORC1 is a master activator of translation (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Saxton &#x00026; Sabatini, 2017</xref>), and therefore translation arrest through mTORC1 inhibition by small molecule compounds, nutrient deprivation, or stresses has been suggested to promote stress granule formation. mTORC1 is embedded in a network of oncogenic kinases, often up-regulated in tumors (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Saxton &#x00026; Sabatini, 2017</xref>). Although triggering tumor metabolism and growth, oncogenic signaling to mTORC1 might counteract stress granule assembly, thereby reducing tumor cell survival.</p><p>In contrast, other reports suggest that mTORC1 enhances stress granule assembly through phosphorylation of its substrates ribosomal protein S6 kinase &#x003b2;-1 (p70-S6K) (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Sfakianos et al, 2018</xref>) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Fournier et al, 2013</xref>). This would suggest that rather than mTORC1 inhibition, its activation under stress is required to enable stress granule formation. If so, stress signals, which activate mTORC1, could not only enhance tumor cell growth but also survival. Thus, inhibitors of the kinase network converging on mTORC1, used as targeted drugs in cancer therapy (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Porta et al, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Saxton &#x00026; Sabatini, 2017</xref>), might disrupt stress granules. Therefore, stress granules could serve as a novel surrogate marker for therapy response.</p><p>If mTORC1 activity is needed for stress granule assembly, this implies that mTORC1 is active under stress. Inhibitory stress inputs to mTORC1 have been reported in much detail (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Demetriades et al, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Saxton &#x00026; Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Su &#x00026; Dai, 2017</xref>), but only little is known about activating stress signals to mTORC1 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Heberle et al, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Su &#x00026; Dai, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, it is unknown whether such activating signaling cues inhibit or promote stress granule assembly. To tackle this gap in our knowledge, we used a combined experimental and computational modelling approach to systematically identify kinases, which activate mTORC1 upon stress. We identify the oncogenic kinases phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and MAPK p38 (MAPK/p38) as main stress-driven activators of mTORC1. We also addressed their hierarchy and found that when highly active, PI3K is the main driver of mTORC1 activity; however, the impact of p38 becomes apparent as PI3K activity declines.</p><p>Importantly, we report that both PI3K and p38 promote stress granule formation. So far, translation-inhibitory cues have been recognized to mainly drive stress granule assembly (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Panas et al, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Protter &#x00026; Parker, 2016</xref>). In contrast, we establish here that the two major translation activators, PI3K (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Robichaud &#x00026; Sonenberg, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Saxton &#x00026; Sabatini, 2017</xref>) and p38 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Gonskikh &#x00026; Polacek, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Robichaud &#x00026; Sonenberg, 2017</xref>), enhance stress granule assembly by activating mTORC1 under stress. Thus, we assign a new function to the key oncogenic kinases PI3K and p38: not only do they promote tumors by enhancing their metabolism and growth but they also concomitantly enhance stress granule formation, likely increasing tumor cell survival. We coin the term of pro-stress-granule-kinases for them and we anticipate that future studies will add further oncogenic kinases to this family.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3"><title>mTORC1 activity is required for stress granule formation</title><p>The carcinogenic metalloid arsenite is a frequently used tool compound to study stress granules (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kedersha &#x00026; Anderson, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Turakhiya et al, 2018</xref>). Arsenite induces acute stress by interference with thiol groups of numerous proteins, such as, glutathione, glutathione reductase, and thioredoxin reductase, thus leading to oxidative stress and ultimately translation arrest (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Hughes, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">McEwen et al, 2005</xref>). In agreement with previous studies (<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">White et al, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Fournier et al, 2013</xref>), we found that in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, arsenite exposure led to stress-induced translation arrest, as determined by the phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; at serine 51 (eIF2&#x003b1;-S51) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A and B</xref>). Furthermore, arsenite induced stress granule assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>), as monitored by the appearance of cytoplasmic foci, positive for the bona fide stress granule marker G3BP1 (Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1).

Consequently, the TSC complex detaches from lysosomes (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Menon et al, 2014</xref>), the platform at which mTORC1 is active (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Saxton &#x00026; Sabatini, 2017</xref>). The TSC is the GTPase-activating protein for the small GTPase Rheb, which activates mTORC1 at the lysosome (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Manning &#x00026; Cantley, 2003</xref>). Thus, the TSC acts as an insulin and amino acid&#x02013;sensitive lysosomal mTORC1 suppressor (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Demetriades et al, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Menon et al, 2014</xref>). Under stress, TSC activation and localization to lysosomes has been proposed as a universal response to cellular stress (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Demetriades et al, 2016</xref>). In contrast, we observed enhanced phosphorylation of TSC2-T1462 upon arsenite stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1C and D</xref>). Thus, we report that stress-induced Akt inhibits the TSC. PI3K inhibition reduced TSC2-T1462 phosphorylation and p70-S6K-pT389 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A and B</xref>), demonstrating that under stress, PI3K and Akt signal through the TSC to activate mTORC1. Thus, we conclude that TSC inhibition upon stress contributes to mTORC1 activation. We propose that the TSC acts as an integrator of activating and inhibitory stress cues, rather than being a universal mediator of inhibitory stress signals.</p><p>We next asked which upstream cue activates PI3K upon stress. The insulin receptor (IR) has been proposed to enhance PI3K signaling upon oxidative stress (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Mehdi et al, 2005</xref>). To test this, we inhibited the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E and F</xref>), required for IR-mediated activation of PI3K (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Razquin Navas &#x00026; Thedieck, 2017</xref>). Whereas IRS1 protein levels were significantly reduced by two siRNAs, Akt-T308 and p70-S6K-T389 phosphorylations were not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E and F</xref>). Thus, the IR-IRS1 axis does not enhance PI3K-PDK1 signaling nor mTORC1 activity upon arsenite stress. The super-oncogene RAS is another upstream regulator of PI3K (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Viciana et al, 1994</xref>), known to respond to growth factor receptors. RAS is a small GTPase, which is active when GTP-bound. To test whether RAS is activated by arsenite stress, we analysed GTP loading of RAS. For this purpose, we performed pull-down experiments with a GST-coupled RAF-RAS&#x02013;binding domain (RBD), which specifically binds active, GTP-bound RAS but not inactive, GDP-bound RAS. RBD-bound RAS was detected using a pan-RAS antibody. Arsenite stress enhanced RAS-GTP levels, as determined by increased RBD-bound RAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2G and H</xref>), whereas total RAS remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1E and F</xref>). Thus, arsenite stress enhances RAS activity, which may promote PI3K signaling to mTORC1.</p><p>In summary, we report that stress activation of mTORC1 by PI3K is mediated by PDK1, Akt, and the TSC. Yet, it is unknown whether PI3K affects stress granule assembly. Therefore, we analysed stress granule formation upon arsenite, in the absence or presence of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. PI3K inhibition significantly reduced the number of arsenite-induced stress granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2I and J</xref>). We, therefore, conclude that PI3K is required for stress granule assembly. Thus, we assign a novel function to PI3K as a driver of stress granule formation, and its pro-stress granule activity might contribute to PI3K&#x02019;s oncogenic capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Computational modelling predicts PI3K-independent stress signals to Akt and mTORC1</title><p>Although PI3K and PDK1 inhibitors led to a decline in p70-S6K-pT389, we observed that also in the presence of these inhibitors p70-S6K-T389 phosphorylation was still significantly inducible by arsenite stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B and D</xref>). Also stress granule formation was significantly reduced, but still occurred under PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2I and J</xref>). This suggests that next to PI3K, there is another stress-induced signaling route, which promotes stress granule assembly.</p><p>We went on to identify this cue. In principle, any molecule downstream or independent of PI3K could be the transducer of the additional stress signal(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2A</xref>). Rather than testing all possible mediators one by one experimentally, we opted for a systematic computational approach to guide subsequent experimental investigation. In the first attempt to comprehensively model the dynamics of the mTOR network upon stress, we built an ordinary differential equation&#x02013;based computational model. We designed our modelling strategy to systematically map stress-responsive components across the mTOR network.</p><fig id="figS2" fig-type="supplementary-material" specific-use="collapsible" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure S2.</label><caption><title>Dynamic mTOR model.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Scheme summarizing the mTOR pathway.

The IR phosphorylates and recruits IRS1 which in turn recruits and activates PI3K. PI3K promotes the translocation of PDK1 to the membrane, where PDK1 phosphorylates Akt-pT308. Akt phosphorylates and inhibits the endogenous mTORC1 inhibitors PRAS40 at T246 and TSC2 at T1462. Thus, Akt activates mTORC1. p70-S6K inhibits IRS1 by direct phosphorylation at S636/639. PI3K also activates mTORC2, which targets Akt-pS473.

Downstream of insulin and the IR, PI3K activates PDK1, which in turn phosphorylates Akt (Akt &#x02192; Akt-pT308) (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alessi et al, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Stephens et al, 1998</xref>). Akt activates mTORC1 by inhibiting its endogenous suppressors TSC and PRAS40 through phosphorylation at TSC2-T1462 (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Manning et al, 2002</xref>) and PRAS40-T246 (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Kovacina et al, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Nascimento et al, 2010</xref>), respectively (Akt &#x02192; TSC2-pT1462; Akt &#x02192; PRAS40-pT246). Akt and p70-S6K belong to the family of AGC kinases, which are activated by phosphorylation in their activation loop and the hydrophobic motif (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Pearce et al, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Leroux et al, 2018</xref>). Although the kinase for the activation loop is PDK1, the kinases phosphorylating the hydrophobic motif, historically termed PDK2, differ between AGC kinases (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Pearce et al, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Leroux et al, 2018</xref>). The second mTOR complex, mTORC2, is considered the main PDK2 for Akt. mTORC2 is structurally and functionally distinct from mTORC1 and, in response to activation by PI3K, phosphorylates Akt at S473 (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Manning &#x00026; Toker, 2017</xref>). mTORC1 is the PDK2 for p70-S6K (T389), which is also phosphorylated by PDK1 at T229 (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Pullen et al, 1998</xref>). The two AGC kinase modules in our model include all possible combinations of phosphorylation states, that is, non-phosphorylated, single-, or double-phosphorylated species. All single- and double-phosphorylated Akt species are defined as active in our model, whereby phosphorylation at the PDK1 and 2 sites have additive effects on Akt activity. For p70-S6K in our model, only the species phosphorylated at T389 is defined as active, as p70-S6K activity toward its substrate IRS1-S636/639 has been reported to be mTORC1 dependent (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Carlson et al, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Um et al, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Tzatsos &#x00026; Kandror, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We calibrated our dynamic model with quantitative time course data recorded for up to 60 min upon arsenite exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1C and D</xref>).

For this purpose, we added, in agreement with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>), a stress input at the level of PI3K (model II, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5</xref> and <inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="LSA-2018-00257_Supplemental_Data2.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d35e1171" content-type="local-data">Supplemental Data 2</inline-supplementary-material>), and calibrated this model on our time course data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figs S1C, D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3</xref>). Model II was able to simulate the dynamic response of all components across the mTOR network to arsenite stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>, blue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig S6A and B</xref>). Hence, the addition of a stress input to PI3K improved the fit between the simulations and the data. However, for PI3K perturbation (wortmannin), the model failed to simulate the remaining activity at the level of p70-S6K-pT389 and Akt-pS473 as well as other readouts across the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>, orange; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig S6C</xref>). This confirmed that stress activation of PI3K is not sufficient to explain the dynamic stress response of the mTOR network. Thus, we concluded that additional stress inputs might further improve the fit between the simulated and the measured perturbation data.</p><fig id="fig3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Computational model predicts three stress inputs on PI3K, Akt, and mTORC1.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Scheme of model II, with only one stress input on PI3K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig S5</xref>).

We compared the fit between the model simulations and the measured data by calculating the Akaike information criterion (AIC) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We considered that a model represented an improvement over the previous version if the AIC was reduced by at least 5%. Only two models reached the threshold (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, models 1 and 2), in both of which the second stress input targeted the phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473 (Akt &#x02192; Akt-pS473 and Akt-pT308 &#x02192; Akt-pT308-pS473). From these two models, we chose to proceed with model 1 (now renamed model III) as it had the lowest AIC value (1,127) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7</xref> and <inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="LSA-2018-00257_Supplemental_Data3.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d35e1316" content-type="local-data">Supplemental Data 3</inline-supplementary-material>).

Thus, we postulated two hypotheses: when PI3K is inhibited, (1) stress-induction of Akt-pS473 mediates mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref>) and in this case, model III is correct; or (2) Akt-S473 phosphorylation does not activate mTORC1 and there is an additional stress input to mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3E</xref>). If hypothesis (2) is correct, the addition of this third input to our model would be expected to further improve the fit between the model simulations and the measured data. To test the two hypotheses in silico, we added a third stress input to mTORC1 into model IV (model V, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">S11</xref> and <inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="LSA-2018-00257_Supplemental_Data5.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d35e2008" content-type="local-data">Supplemental Data 5</inline-supplementary-material>).

This indicates that the stress signal to mTORC1 is not transduced through mTORC2, again supporting the rejection of hypothesis (1).</p><p>As expected, rictor knockdown reduced Akt-S473 phosphorylation in PI3K-proficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4D and E</xref>). To our surprise, we found that upon PI3K inhibition, rictor knockdown did not affect Akt-pS473 even though it was induced by arsenite stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4D and F</xref>). This indicates that in the absence of PI3K activity, mTORC2 does not mediate Akt-S473 phosphorylation. We further confirmed this finding with Torin1 (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Thoreen et al, 2009</xref>), an ATP-analogue inhibitor, which targets mTOR in both complexes. Torin1 abolished p70-S6K-T389 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Fig S13E</xref>), indicative of mTORC1 inhibition. Akt-S473 phosphorylation was reduced by Torin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Fig S13F</xref>) to the same level as with wortmannin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Fig S13E</xref>), indicating that PI3K and mTORC2 act in the same axis to enhance Akt-pS473. Yet, when PI3K was inactive, Torin1 could not further reduce Akt-pS473, although it remained inducible by arsenite stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Fig S13G</xref>), again suggesting that stress-induction of Akt-pS473 is not mediated by mTORC2 when PI3K is inactive.

To analyse the effect of p38 inhibition on stress-induced p70-S6K-pT389 at different levels of PI3K activity, we combined the p38 inhibitor LY2228820 with wortmannin concentrations from 10 to 100 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">S13L</xref>). The effect of p38 inhibition on p70-S6K-pT389 became significant when PI3K activity (calculated based on Akt-pT308) was 40% or lower. Based on this result, the threshold of PI3K activity for p38 to significantly contribute to mTORC1 activation by stress can be estimated to be 40% in MCF-7 cells.</p><p>How does p38 activate mTORC1? So far, two mechanisms have been proposed: (i) p38 has been suggested to activate mTORC1 through MK2 (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Li et al, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Cully et al, 2010</xref>). Yet, in our hands, MK2 inhibition did not affect mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs 4I&#x02013;K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">S13I&#x02013;K</xref>), indicating that mTORC1 activation by p38 was MK2 independent; (ii) p38 has been proposed to directly phosphorylate raptor and activate mTORC1 (<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al, 2011</xref>), but it is unknown whether this occurs in a PI3K-dependent manner. Hence, in cells with low PI3K activity, p38 might activate mTORC1 either through raptor or via a hitherto unknown mechanism, which requires further investigation in the future.</p><p>To test if the hierarchy between PI3K and p38 is a general feature of stress signaling to mTORC1, we investigated this mechanism in four further cell lines, out of which three were of tumor origin (HeLa, cervix carcinoma; CAL51, breast cancer; and LN18, glioblastoma), whereas one was a non-malignant cell line (HEK293T, human embryonic kidney). Surprisingly, we found that all four cell lines exhibited very low p70-S6K levels, as compared with MCF-7, whereas 4E-BP1 levels were similar or higher than in MCF-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS14">Fig S14B and C</xref>). Thus, we opted for 4E-BP1-T37/46 as the readout to compare the mTORC1 response to p38 inhibition across the five different cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS14">S14D&#x02013;G</xref>). In cells which exhibited enhanced PI3K activity upon stress (enhanced Akt-pT308 in MCF-7, CAL51, LN18, and HEK293T cells), PI3K inhibition was required to observe an effect of p38 inhibition on 4E-BP1-T37/46 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs 5D, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS14">S14A, and D&#x02013;F</xref>). In HeLa cells, PI3K was not responsive to stress, and here p38 inhibition reduced 4E-BP1-pT37/46 also without additional PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS14">S14G</xref>). Thus, p38 inhibition directly affects mTORC1 in cells with low PI3K activity; however, in cells with high PI3K, the impact of p38 only becomes observable when PI3K is suppressed. Hence, we conclude that the hierarchy between PI3K- and p38-mediated stress activation of mTORC1 is a general mechanism preserved among different cancer-derived and nonmalignant cell types.</p><p>The hierarchy of PI3K and p38 in inducing mTORC1 under stress suggests that the same hierarchy might also exist at the level of stress granule assembly. If so, the effect of p38 inhibition on stress granules would only be observable when PI3K activity is low. To test this, we treated arsenite-stressed cells with the p38 inhibitor LY2228820 without or with PI3K inhibition (wortmannin) and analysed the number of stress granules per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5H and I</xref>). Although the p38 inhibitor did not affect stress granule numbers when PI3K was active, p38 inhibition did reduce the amount of stress granules in cells with inactive PI3K. Thus, we identify p38 as a novel regulator of stress granules.</p><p>We conclude that the two pro-stress-granule-kinases PI3K and p38 drive stress granule assembly in a hierarchical manner, as the importance of p38 for stress granule formation becomes apparent as PI3K activity declines.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s9"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present work is the first attempt to model the full mTOR network, including both mTOR complexes, to identify activating stress inputs and their co-dependency.

So far, the oncogenic effects of PI3K, p38, and mTORC1 have been mainly assigned to the fact that they enhance metabolism, thereby promoting cell growth. Our results suggest that through stress granule formation, PI3K, p38, and mTORC1 also promote cell survival, adding to their oncogenic capacity. Hence, stress granule inhibition might be a valuable marker to monitor the effectiveness of therapies targeting PI3K, p38, and mTORC1. Of note, stress granule disruption by compounds has been hitherto difficult (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Timalsina et al, 2018</xref>). The understanding of signaling cues mediating stress granule assembly provides us new tools, such as PI3K and p38 inhibitors, to target stress granules for research and therapies.</p><p>Also, the hierarchy of PI3K and p38 signaling to mTORC1 and stress granules, established in the present study is of high relevance for cancer treatment, as ongoing clinical trials combine the p38 inhibitor LY2228820 with genotoxic therapies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02364206">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02364206</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01663857">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01663857</ext-link>), known to induce stress granules (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Moeller et al, 2004</xref>). Our findings suggest that this is a promising strategy as LY2228820 inhibits stress induction of mTORC1 and stress granule formation, and this mechanism might be predominant in cancers with moderate or low PI3K activity. To investigate this in patient tissues, we analysed protein array data of the invasive breast cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Indeed, we found in tumors with low PI3K activity that mTORC1 readouts (p70-S6K-pT389 and mTOR-pS2448) as well as Akt-S473 phosphorylation correlated with p38 activity (p38-pT180/Y182 [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Corre et al, 2017</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>). In contrast, when PI3K activity was high, phosphorylation of Akt-S473 and mTORC1 substrates did not correlate with p38 phosphorylation. This suggests that p38 specifically activates Akt and mTORC1 in tumors with low PI3K activity and that such patients may exhibit a better response rate to p38 inhibitors. Thus, we advocate cautious monitoring of PI3K readouts in clinical trials to predict treatment outcome for p38 inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s10"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s11"><title>Cell culture and cell treatments</title><p>Experiments were performed in MCF-7 cells overexpressing LC3-GFP, a gift from Joern Dengjel.

The membranes were blocked in 5% BSA in TBST. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, and afterwards, the membranes were washed and incubated for at least 2 h with the HRP-coupled secondary antibody (goat&#x02013;anti-mouse and goat&#x02013;anti-rabbit). For detection, Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate (Cat. No. 32209; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or SuperSignal West FEMTO (Cat.

Z stack images (8 slides, 0.5 &#x003bc;m) were taken with an AxioObserver Z1 compound microscope (Carl Zeiss) with an Apotome (5 pictures per slide), 63&#x000d7; objective and an AxioCam MRm3 CCD camera (Carl Zeiss). For quantitative analysis, maximum intensity projections were generated from three to four representative fields of view, which were captured for each condition with identical exposure times and the same magnification. For presentation in figures, maximum intensity projections were exported as TIFF with no compression using Zen2012 blue edition software (Zeiss), and brightness or contrast were adjusted for better visibility. Brightness or contrast adjustment was not performed before quantification, and thus did not influence image quantification. For quantification of stress granules, G3BP1-positive foci and number of cells were manually counted over four representative fields of view for each biological replicate. The relative number of stress granules per cell was calculated as the ratio between G3BP1-positive foci and number of cells for each field of view.

In general, the model describes the activity state (e.g., phosphorylation) of the following species: IR-&#x003b2;, IRS1, PI3K, PDK1, Akt, PRAS40, TSC2, p70-S6K, and 4E-BP1. For the sake of simplicity, different compartments and cell volume were neglected. All species activations and deactivations were simulated using mass action kinetics. Inhibitions were simulated to be concentration dependent, that is, the efficiency of inhibition correlates with the concentration of the inhibiting species relative to its total concentration (including active and inactive variants based on phosphorylation states). If the concentration of the inhibiting species variant (e.g., TSC2) equals that of the total concentration of all species variants (e.g., TSC2 + TSC2_pT1462), then that species variant is fully inhibiting its downstream target. A Boolean-like inhibition scheme was applied for inhibitory inputs to the model, for example, wortmannin or MK-2206, where only in the presence of these components, their respective targets get fully (PI3K) or partially (Akt) inhibited.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Parameter settings</title><p>The model was parameterised on the following experimental datasets: arsenite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1C</xref>), arsenite + wortmannin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig S3A</xref>), and arsenite + MK-2206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig S3C</xref>). The average relative intensities and standard deviations were determined for the following observable species: Akt_pT308, Akt_pS473, TSC2_pT1462, PRAS40_pS183, PRAS40_pT246, p70_S6K_pT389, p70_S6K_pT229, 4EBP1_T37/46, and IRS1_pS636 (<inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="LSA-2018-00257_Supplemental_Data7.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d35e2849" content-type="local-data">Supplemental Data 7</inline-supplementary-material>). In the case of Akt, PRAS40 and p70_S6K immunoblot data were linked to the total amount of phosphorylation of the respective species (e.g., Akt_pS473 phosphorylation was linked to the sum of Akt_pS473 and Akt_pT308_pS473). As at time point zero of arsenite treatment the initial species concentrations vary across datasets, we included condition-specific initial concentration parameters (arsenite, arsenite + wortmannin, and arsenite + MK-2206). To keep the number of parameters as low as possible, we integrated several assumptions: because mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities were not measured directly, but rather through the phosphorylation of their respective downstream targets, mTORC1 and mTORC2 were modelled implicitly via their downstream effects (e.g., inhibition of mTORC1 by TSC2 was realised by adding TSC2 inhibition to the phosphorylation of all mTORC1 readouts [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figs S2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">S9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">S11</xref>]). We used PRAS40_pS183, p70_S6K_pT389, and 4EBP1_T37/46 as mTORC1 activity readouts and Akt_pS473 as mTORC2 activity readout. Because MCF-7 cells were starved overnight against growth factors in all experiments, activation via insulin was not included. The value for the inhibition by MK-2206 and wortmannin was derived from the corresponding readouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2C&#x02013;E</xref>). To reduce the number of model parameters and as because of serum starvation, the mTOR network activity is at baseline, we set the initial concentration of all double-phosphorylated species (Akt_pT308_pS473, PRAS40_pT246_pS183, and p70_S6K_pT229_pT389) to zero. Because the effectiveness of a second phosphorylation for AGC kinases such as Akt and p70_S6K is enhanced by its first phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Pearce et al, 2010</xref>), we applied a factor of two to the second phosphorylation step relative to the parameter responsible for the first phosphorylation. The exact value of the second step phosphorylation enhancement does not affect the overall fitting quality and the outcome of the predictions. We finally assumed that dephosphorylation of the same phosphosite for the species Akt, PRAS40, and p70_S6K is equal, regardless of the species&#x02019; current phosphorylation state (e.g., the parameter for the dephosphorylation of Akt_pS473 to Akt possesses the same value as the parameter for the dephosphorylation of Akt_pT308_pS473 to Akt_pT308).

To narrow down the solution space of free parameters, each subsequent parameter identification iteration was based on fixed parameters of the last rounds. Moreover, to reduce the parameter space for the model with three stress inputs (model V), we created an artificial dataset under the assumption that remaining levels of Akt-pS473, p70-S6K-pT389, 4E-BP1-pT37/46, and PRAS40-pS183 after wortmannin inhibition are due to an additional input. The iterative process for parameter estimation was initialized with an LHS500 run to find parameter values that best resembled our data. Next, a PLE run was performed, resulting in a first set of identifiable parameters that were consequently fixed. If PLE reported no identifiable parameter, another LHS500 analysis was performed. The solutions of the LHS500 run were analysed for the best portion of fitting solutions by analysing the goodness of fit of all 500 solutions with k-means clustering. Specifically, two clusters were sought and only solutions corresponding to the cluster with the better mean &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> fitting value were kept for further analysis (see <inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="LSA-2018-00257_Supplemental_Data8.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d35e3015" content-type="local-data">Supplemental Data 8</inline-supplementary-material> for details). The remaining parameter distributions were analysed per parameter for showing unimodal distributions, that is, ending nearly always in the same value range regardless of the starting point for parameter optimisation (<inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="LSA-2018-00257_Supplemental_Data8.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d35e3018" content-type="local-data">Supplemental Data 1</inline-supplementary-material>). Parameters with unimodal value distributions were fixed by identifying the maximum value of a nonparametric kernel-smoothing distribution over each parameter-specific unimodal distribution. After this step, another parameter iteration round was started with a new PLE analysis until no remaining free parameters were left.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM11"><label>Supplemental Data 8.</label><p>Parameter fixation approach.<inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="LSA-2018-00257_Supplemental_Data8.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d35e3026" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Text mining</title><p>To automatically mine publications that relate Akt or PDK2s with other interactors, MEDLINE and the open access subset of PMC were linguistically preprocessed. Required text analysis before actual text mining (such as part of speech tagging) includes segmentation of text into basic units (sentences and words), acronym recognition, and shallow grammatical analysis, among others, and was conducted by using tools from the JCore repository (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hahn et al, 2016</xref>). Eligible texts for text mining included more than 28 million abstracts from MEDLINE as of January 2018 and about 1.7 million full texts from PMC (open access only) as of October 2017. Next, a semantic analysis was carried out to identify the mention of genes and interactions between them. Gene identification and mapping into the NCBI Gene database was performed using GeNo (<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Wermter et al, 2009</xref>), whereas interactions were identified by using the tool BioSem (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bui &#x00026; Sloot, 2012</xref>). Next, the sentences in which BioSem identified interactions were filtered for the occurrence of the term &#x0201c;stress&#x0201d; and scanned for references of Akt or PDK2s as interaction member.

The patient dataset was reduced to the overlap between both RPPA and RNA-seq datasets, and this dataset was used for all further downstream analysis (n = 869). Patients were initially divided by the median of Akt_pT308 phosphorylation into two groups of high and low phosphorylation. In addition, the high or low Akt_pT308 group was further divided by the median of the p38_pT180Y182 phosphorylation into high and low groups. This grouped the patients into four groups. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied for group comparisons of Akt, Akt_pT308, Akt_pS473, p38MAPK, p38_pT180Y182, p70-S6K, p70-S6K_pT389, mTOR, and mTOR_pS2448 measurements.
