  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
Our computational model of the circadian clock comprised the feedback loop between LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1), and a predicted, interlocking feedback loop involving TOC1 and a hypothetical component Y. Experiments based on model predictions suggested GIGANTEA (GI) as a candidate for Y. We now extend the model to include a recently demonstrated feedback loop between the TOC1 homologues PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7), PRR9 and LHY and CCA1. This three-loop network explains the rhythmic phenotype of toc1 mutant alleles. Model predictions fit closely to new data on the gi;lhy;cca1 mutant, which confirm that GI is a major contributor to Y function. Analysis of the three-loop network suggests that the plant clock consists of morning and evening oscillators, coupled intracellularly, which may be analogous to coupled, morning and evening clock cells in Drosophila and the mouse.

  <p>The model describes a three loops model of the Arabidopsis circadian clock. It provides initial conditions, parameter values and reactions for the production rates of the following species: LHY mRNA (cLm), cytoplasmic LHY (cLc), nuclear LHY (cLn), TOC1 mRNA (cTm), cytoplasmic TOC1 (cTc), nuclear TOC1 (cTn),  X mRNA (cXm), cytoplasmic X (cXc), nuclear X (cXn), Y mRNA (cYm), cytoplasmic Y (cYc), nuclear Y (cYn), nuclear P (cPn), APRR7/9 mRNA, cytoplasmic APRR7/9, and nuclear APRR7/9. </p>
  <p>The paper describes the behaviour of the model in constant light (LL) and day-night cycle (LD). However, the current model only contains the LL cycle. Some parameter values  should be changed from the wild-type (WT) ones in order to simulate the effect of mutations. These changes are listed in the notes of relevant parameters.</p>
