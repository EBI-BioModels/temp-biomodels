    dc:description """<body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>The model reproduces the oscillations for mRNA and protein species as depicted in Fig 3 of the plot. The model differs slightly from that given in the paper and this was made after a communication from the authors. The values of parameters tcvriclkp, tcdvpmt and dccpt are slightly different. Also, although it is not given in the paper, rate laws for reactions re20, re28, re35, re42, re43 and re45 are multiplied by a specie. Model was successfully tested on MathSBML</p>
