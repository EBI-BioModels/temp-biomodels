    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The physiological hallmark of heat-shock response in yeast
    is a rapid, enormous increase in the concentration of
    trehalose. Normally found in growing yeast cells and other
    organisms only as traces, trehalose becomes a crucial protector
    of proteins and membranes against a variety of stresses,
    including heat, cold, starvation, desiccation, osmotic or
    oxidative stress, and exposure to toxicants. Trehalose is
    produced from glucose 6-phosphate and uridine diphosphate
    glucose in a two-step process, and recycled to glucose by
    trehalases. Even though the trehalose cycle consists of only a
    few metabolites and enzymatic steps, its regulatory structure
    and operation are surprisingly complex. The article begins with
    a review of experimental observations on the regulation of the
    trehalose cycle in yeast and proposes a canonical model for its
    analysis. The first part of this analysis demonstrates the
    benefits of the various regulatory features by means of
    controlled comparisons with models of otherwise equivalent
    pathways lacking these features. The second part elucidates the
    significance of the expression pattern of the trehalose cycle
    genes in response to heat shock. Interestingly, the genes
    contributing to trehalose formation are up-regulated to very
    different degrees, and even the trehalose degrading trehalases
    show drastically increased activity during heat-shock response.
    Again using the method of controlled comparisons, the model
    provides rationale for the observed pattern of gene expression
    and reveals benefits of the counterintuitive trehalase
    up-regulation.</p>
