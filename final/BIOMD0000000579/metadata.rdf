    &lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="bibo:abstract"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;HEPNet is an electronic representation of metabolic
    reactions occurring within human cellular organization focusing
    on inflow and outflow of the energy currency ATP, GTP and other
    energy associated moieties. The backbone of HEPNet consists of
    primary bio-molecules such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats
    which ultimately constitute the chief source for the synthesis
    and obliteration of energy currencies in a cell. A series of
    biochemical pathways and reactions constituting the catabolism
    and anabolism of various metabolites are portrayed through
    cellular compartmentalization. The depicted pathways function
    synchronously toward an overarching goal of producing ATP and
    other energy associated moieties to bring into play a variety
    of cellular functions. HEPNet is manually curated with raw data
    from experiments and is also connected to KEGG and Reactome
    databases. This model has been validated by simulating it with
    physiological states like fasting, starvation, exercise and
    disease conditions like glycaemia, uremia and dihydrolipoamide
    dehydrogenase deficiency (DLDD). The results clearly indicate
    that ATP is the master regulator under different metabolic
    conditions and physiological states. The results also highlight
    that energy currencies play a minor role. However, the moiety
    creatine phosphate has a unique character, since it is a
    ready-made source of phosphoryl groups for the rapid synthesis
    of ATP from ADP. HEPNet provides a framework for further
    expanding the network diverse age groups of both the sexes,
    followed by the understanding of energetics in more complex
    metabolic pathways that are related to human disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
