    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The aggregation of proteins has been hypothesized to be an
    underlying cause of many neurological disorders including
    Alzheimer&apos;s, Parkinson&apos;s, and Huntington&apos;s diseases; protein
    aggregation is also important to normal life function in cases
    such as G to F-actin, glutamate dehydrogenase, and tubulin and
    flagella formation. For this reason, the underlying mechanism
    of protein aggregation, and accompanying kinetic models for
    protein nucleation and growth (growth also being called
    elongation, polymerization, or fibrillation in the literature),
    have been investigated for more than 50 years. As a way to
    concisely present the key prior literature in the protein
    aggregation area, Table 1 in the main text summarizes 23 papers
    by 10 groups of authors that provide 5 basic classes of
    mechanisms for protein aggregation over the period from 1959 to
    2007. However, and despite this major prior effort, still
    lacking are both (i) anything approaching a consensus mechanism
    (or mechanisms), and (ii) a generally useful, and thus widely
    used, simplest/&quot;Ockham&apos;s razor&quot; kinetic model and associated
    equations that can be routinely employed to analyze a broader
    range of protein aggregation kinetic data. Herein we
    demonstrate that the 1997 Finke-Watzky (F-W) 2-step mechanism
    of slow continuous nucleation, A --&gt; B (rate constant k1),
    followed by typically fast, autocatalytic surface growth, A + B
    --&gt; 2B (rate constant k2), is able to quantitatively account
    for the kinetic curves from all 14 representative data sets of
    neurological protein aggregation found by a literature search
    (the prion literature was largely excluded for the purposes of
    this study in order provide some limit to the resultant
    literature that was covered). The F-W model is able to
    deconvolute the desired nucleation, k1, and growth, k2, rate
    constants from those 14 data sets obtained by four different
    physical methods, for three different proteins, and in nine
    different labs. The fits are generally good, and in many cases
    excellent, with R2 values &gt;or=0.98 in all cases. As such,
    this contribution is the current record of the widest set of
    protein aggregation data best fit by what is also the simplest
    model offered to date. Also provided is the mathematical
    connection between the 1997 F-W 2-step mechanism and the 2000
    3-step mechanism proposed by Saitô and co-workers. In
    particular, the kinetic equation for Saitô&apos;s 3-step
    mechanism is shown to be mathematically identical to the
    earlier, 1997 2-step F-W mechanism under the 3 simplifying
    assumptions Saitô and co-workers used to derive their
    kinetic equation. A list of the 3 main caveats/limitations of
    the F-W kinetic model is provided, followed by the main
    conclusions from this study as well as some needed future
    experiments.</p>
