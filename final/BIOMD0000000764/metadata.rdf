Abstract: 
IA mathematical model for the treatment of cancer using chemovirotherapy is developed with the aim of determining the efficacy of three drug infusion methods: constant, single bolus, and periodic treatments. The model is in the form of ODEs and is further extended into DDEs to account for delays as a result of the infection of tumor cells by the virus and chemotherapeutic drug responses. Analysis of the model is carried out for each of the three drug infusion methods. Analytic solutions are determined where possible and stability analysis of both steady state solutions for the ODEs and DDEs is presented. The results indicate that constant and periodic drug infusion methods are more efficient compared to a single bolus injection. Numerical simulations show that with a large virus burst size, irrespective of the drug infusion method, chemovirotherapy is highly effective compared to either treatments. The simulations further show that both delays increase the period within which a tumor can be cleared from body tissue.
