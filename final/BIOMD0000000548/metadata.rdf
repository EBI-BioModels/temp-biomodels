    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>In Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD), there is evidence that
    alpha-synuclein (alphaSN) aggregation is coupled to
    dysfunctional or overburdened protein quality control systems,
    in particular the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here, we develop
    a simple dynamical model for the on-going conflict between
    alphaSN aggregation and the maintenance of a functional
    proteasome in the healthy cell, based on the premise that
    proteasomal activity can be titrated out by mature alphaSN
    fibrils and their protofilament precursors. In the presence of
    excess proteasomes the cell easily maintains homeostasis.
    However, when the ratio between the available proteasome and
    the alphaSN protofilaments is reduced below a threshold level,
    we predict a collapse of homeostasis and onset of oscillations
    in the proteasome concentration. Depleted proteasome opens for
    accumulation of oligomers. Our analysis suggests that the onset
    of PD is associated with a proteasome population that becomes
    occupied in periodic degradation of aggregates. This behavior
    is found to be the general state of a proteasome/chaperone
    system under pressure, and suggests new interpretations of
    other diseases where protein aggregation could stress elements
    of the protein quality control system.</p>
