    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide
    synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which has a number
    of important physiological functions in the microvasculature.
    The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical
    determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have
    analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and
    formulated a model to estimate NO production by the
    microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The
    model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics
    of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its
    intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from
    microvessels was in the range of 0.005-0.1 microM/s. This range
    of predicted values is in agreement with some experimental
    values but is much lower than other rates previously measured
    or estimated from experimental data with the help of
    mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the
    model predictions and previously reported results based on
    experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity
    of the arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released
    through eNOS-independent mechanisms, such as catalysis by
    neuronal NOS (nNOS). We also used our model to test the
    sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS
    concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results
    indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be
    attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the
    microvascular endothelial cells.</p>
