    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Many molecular chaperones are also known as heat shock
    proteins because they are synthesised in increased amounts
    after brief exposure of cells to elevated temperatures. They
    have many cellular functions and are involved in the folding of
    nascent proteins, the re-folding of denatured proteins, the
    prevention of protein aggregation, and assisting the targeting
    of proteins for degradation by the proteasome and lysosomes.
    They also have a role in apoptosis and are involved in
    modulating signals for immune and inflammatory responses.
    Stress-induced transcription of heat shock proteins requires
    the activation of heat shock factor (HSF). Under normal
    conditions, HSF is bound to heat shock proteins resulting in
    feedback repression. During stress, cellular proteins undergo
    denaturation and sequester heat shock proteins bound to HSF,
    which is then able to become transcriptionally active. The
    induction of heat shock proteins is impaired with age and there
    is also a decline in chaperone function. Aberrant/damaged
    proteins accumulate with age and are implicated in several
    important age-related conditions (e.g. Alzheimer&apos;s disease,
    Parkinson&apos;s disease, and cataract). Therefore, the balance
    between damaged proteins and available free chaperones may be
    greatly disturbed during ageing. We have developed a
    mathematical model to describe the heat shock system. The aim
    of the model is two-fold: to explore the heat shock system and
    its implications in ageing; and to demonstrate how to build a
    model of a biological system using our simulation system
    (biology of ageing e-science integration and simulation
    (BASIS)).</p>
