  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
Everyone who has ever tried to radically change metabolic fluxes knows that it is often harder to determine which enzymes have to be modified than it is to actually implement these changes. In the more traditional genetic engineering approaches ’bottle-necks’ are pinpointed using qualitative, intuitive approaches, but the alleviation of suspected ’rate-limiting’ steps has not often been successful. Here the authors demonstrate that a model of pyruvate distribution in Lactococcus lactis based on enzyme kinetics in combination with metabolic control analysis clearly indicates the key control points in the flux to acetoin and diacetyl, important flavour compounds. The model presented here (available at http://jjj.biochem.sun.ac.za/wcfs.html) showed that the enzymes with the greatest effect on this flux resided outside the acetolactate synthase branch itself. Experiments confirmed the predictions of the model, i.e. knocking out lactate dehydrogenase and overexpressing NADH oxidase increased the flux through the acetolactate synthase branch from 0 to 75% of measured product formation rates.
   </p>
  <p> The paper does not have any figure to be put as a curation figure in the BioModels database. The model does reproduce the fluxes and control-coefficients given in Figure 2 and Table 4. To reproduce the results, the model was changed from the description in the article according to the model on JWS: the parameter Kmpyr was changed to 2.5 from 25. The equillibrium constant for PTA reaction (R4) was changed from 0.0281 to 0.0065. The Km for oxygen in the NOX reaction (R13) was changed from 0.01 to 0.2. Slight deviations between the values in the article and the model results may stem from different algorithms used for finding the steady state.
