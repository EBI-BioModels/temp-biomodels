  &lt;pre&gt;MODELING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN AVASCULAR CANCEROUS CELLS AND ACQUIRED IMMUNE RESPONSE

B. DUBEY, UMA S. DUBEY and SANDIP BANERJEE

Abstract

This paper deals with the interaction between dispersed cancer cells and the major populations of the immune system, namely, the T helper cells, T Cytotoxic cells, B cells, and antibodies produced. The system is described by a set of five ordinary differential equations. Both local and global stability of the system has been investigated. It has been observed that under appropriate conditions this interaction is capable of controlling the growth of these cancer cells. The analytical findings are supported by numerical and computational analytical methods.&lt;/pre&gt;
