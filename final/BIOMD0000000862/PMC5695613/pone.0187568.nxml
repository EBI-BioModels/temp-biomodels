Bioinformatics analysis and experimental results from the literature were used to create and calibrate models of gene regulatory networks in OA involving miR-140 along with key regulators such as NF-&#x003ba;B, SMAD3, and RUNX2. The individual models were created with the modelling standard, Systems Biology Markup Language, and integrated to examine the overall effect of miR-140 on cartilage homeostasis. Down-regulation of miR-140 may have either detrimental or protective effects for cartilage, indicating that the role of miR-140 is complex. Studies of individual networks in isolation may therefore lead to different conclusions. This indicated the need to combine the five chosen individual networks involving miR-140 into an integrated model. This model suggests that the overall effect of miR-140 is to change the response to an IL-1 stimulus from a prolonged increase in matrix degrading enzymes to a pulse-like response so that cartilage degradation is temporary. Our current model can easily be modified and extended as more experimental data become available about the role of miR-140 in OA. In addition, networks of other microRNAs that are important in OA could be incorporated. A fully integrated model could not only aid our understanding of the mechanisms of microRNAs in ageing cartilage but could also provide a useful tool to investigate the effect of potential interventions to prevent cartilage loss.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K006312/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1366-1399</contrib-id><name><surname>Proctor</surname><given-names>Carole J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000341</institution-id><institution>Arthritis Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K006312/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1366-1399</contrib-id><name><surname>Proctor</surname><given-names>Carole J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>CJP was supported by the Medical Research Council (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mrc.ac.uk/">https://www.mrc.ac.uk/</ext-link>) and Arthritis Research UK (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/">http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/</ext-link>)as part of the MRC-Arthritis Research UK Centre for Integrated research into Musculoskeletal Ageing (CIMA) (grant number MR/K006312/1).

They are known to enhance degradation of mRNAs and also to inhibit translation of mRNAs by a variety of mechanisms. It is known that miRNAs play an important role in complex networks that are enriched with positive and negative feedback loops. This has led to many researchers taking a systems biology approach whereby experimental data is integrated with mathematical modelling, e.g., review by Vera et al, 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Previous models have used functions to represent inhibition and activation in a series of ordinary differential equations using deterministic algorithms. These models have provided useful insight into the expected behaviour of the system due to the presence of miRNAs in different network motifs (small regulatory circuits that recur in gene networks) [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], such as positive feedback, negative feedback, and feedforward loops. In this study, we considered these motifs but unlike previous models, we explicitly modelled the interactions between different components using mass action kinetics. Since many molecular numbers such as genes and mRNA may be low, we also used stochastic simulation.</p><p>Positive feedback loops occur where two components in a system either positively or negatively regulate each other. Whereas positive regulation leads to signal amplification and a longer lasting cellular response, negative regulation may lead to bistability with one of the components staying switched on whilst the other is turned off. Since miRNAs are mainly involved in negative regulation, we only considered the latter situation. For example, a transcription factor (TF) may inhibit the synthesis of a miRNA that, in turn, enhances the degradation of the TF mRNA (Figures A-B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187568.s001">S1 File</xref>). Negative feedback occurs when two components in a system regulate each other in an incoherent fashion, e.g., component A activates component B whereas B inhibits A (Figure C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187568.s001">S1 File</xref>). This provides a homeostatic mechanism and is a very common motif in protein signalling and transcriptional networks leading to oscillatory behaviour ([<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]) (Figure D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187568.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>A coherent feedforward loop may either consist of a double positive or a double negative interaction (Figure E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187568.s001">S1 File</xref> illustrates a double negative loop). They function as sign-sensitive delay elements, extend the duration of target repression, or may prevent leaking of target genes. We only considered double negative loops in this study. In this type of loop the miRNA mediates a delay in the response of target gene to TF (see Vera <italic>et al</italic>. Fig 4.6) [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On the other hand, incoherent feedforward loops produce accelerated and pulse-like responses to signals (Figure F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187568.s001">S1 File</xref>). It has been suggested that the function of miRNAs in these loops is to provide fine-tuning and that they act as noise buffers [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>MiRNAs have been implicated in many diseases such as cancer [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], neurodegeneration [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and osteoarthritis (OA) [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. OA is a disease of the joints characterised by loss of cartilage, abnormal bone growth, e.g., osteophytes, and changes to the synovium. Once thought to be mainly a degenerative disorder, it is now considered that inflammation may be important in disease progression. The cartilage mainly consists of an extracellular matrix (ECM) with chondrocytes (the only cell type) sparsely distributed throughout the ECM. Chondrocytes maintain the cartilage by responding to signals (growth factors and cytokines) to up-regulate anabolic and catabolic processes. There is evidence from several studies that miRNAs are involved in regulating gene expression in signalling pathways that control cartilage turnover [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In particular, miR-140 has been consistently found to have a significant role in cartilage ageing and the development of OA in studies from different groups [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We confirmed its importance (and that of other miRNAs such as miR-455 [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) by integrating information on miRNA targets and OA-associated genes. In view of this, we started by investigating the mechanisms of gene regulation by miR-140 using experimental data from the literature and the above bioinformatics result. We also used the bioinformatics results to search for potential novel miRNAs for OA.</p><p>To date, computational models of the role of miRNAs in OA are lacking, although models have been developed in oncogenesis and ischemic vascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, we adapted the generic models (described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187568.s001">S1 File</xref>) and constructed five different networks based on experimental evidence from the literature, where miR-140 is involved in signalling pathways relevant to OA [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We used the dynamical behaviour of the relevant components in the network to infer the type of motif connecting miR-140 to the other components. Finally we integrated the five individual models to examine the overall effect of miR-140 on cartilage turnover. The models demonstrated how computational modelling can help to increase our understanding of the role of miRNAs in OA and highlighted the need for integrated approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Modelling</title><p>The models were constructed in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] using the Python tool SBML shorthand [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. SBML is a modelling standard that allows for model sharing and development and enables models to be simulated in a wide range of freely available software tools. The models were simulated using COPASI 4.18 [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and tools developed at Newcastle University [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (further details below).

This algorithm simulates every reaction, updating the number of molecules of each species after a reaction occurs. At each time-step random numbers are generated to determine the next reaction to occur and the time interval to that reaction. The probability of any particular reaction occurring is proportional to its associated parameter value and the number of substrate molecules. Each stochastic simulation produces a different trajectory. Therefore, multiple stochastic simulations were carried out on a cluster using software based on the Gillespie algorithm that was developed at Newcastle University [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The input for the simulation was the duration time (virtual time) in seconds (typically the equivalent of 4 or 8 hours), the number of intervals to be saved to an output file (1000), and the initial conditions and parameter values (which are contained in the SBML files and can also be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187568.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Deterministic simulation</title><p>For deterministic simulations, we used the LSODA algorithm in COPASI, a method for solving stiff and non-stiff systems of ordinary differential equations by automatic selection [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Even when data are available, they may not be appropriate as parameter values are usually dependent on cell type and experimental conditions. Therefore, we initially chose parameters with an order of magnitude that would be expected for the process, e.g., degradation rates were chosen to give half-lives that were in an appropriate range), and then synthesis rates were set to obtain the chosen steady state level. In the model of miR-140 in the TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway, parameters were chosen to fit experimental data that shows that Smad3 is rapidly phosphorylated after the addition of TGF-&#x003b2; (peaking at 30&#x02013;45 minutes), and due to negative feedback is de-phosphorylated by 8 hours, although still above basal at this time-point [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Availability of models</title><p>The models were deposited in Biomodels [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and assigned the identifiers [MODEL1610100000-1610100004, MODEL1705170000-1705170005].

Since TGF-&#x003b2; signalling is important in maintaining cartilage homeostasis, we considered that the SMAD3/miR-140 interaction was worthy of further investigation.

A study by Pais <italic>et al</italic>. showed that TGF-&#x003b2; signalling promotes phosphorylation of SMAD3, which in turn binds to the promoter of the miR-140 gene to inhibit transcription [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition miR-140 inhibits production of SMAD3 protein but does not affect levels of <italic>SMAD3</italic> (mRNA) [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This data suggests that miR-140 binds to <italic>SMAD3</italic> mRNA to inhibit its translation rather than enhancing its degradation. This is an example of a positive feedback loop mediated by a double negative loop as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. We constructed a simple model of this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Pais <italic>et al</italic>. show that miR-140 is transiently suppressed by TGF-&#x003b2; and that levels return to basal by 48 hours [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is due to negative feedback loops in signalling pathways, which act to ensure that signalling is only transient to prevent adverse effects from over-activation. A well-known negative feedback loop in TGF-&#x003b2; signalling is the up-regulation of the inhibitory SMAD7, which may enhance degradation of TGF-&#x003b2; receptors and prevent phosphorylation of SMAD3. Therefore, we included SMAD7 in the model, and, for simplicity, we assumed that SMAD7 directly inactivated TGF-&#x003b2;. To model this we included two pools of TGF-&#x003b2;, either active (TGFb_A) or inactive (TGFb_I). We assumed that TGF-&#x003b2; is initially activated which leads to rapid phosphorylation of SMAD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). If miR-140 levels are initially high, then after SMAD3 phosphorylation, miR-140 declines but then levels recover again due to the negative feedback via SMAD7, which inactivates TGF-&#x003b2;. However, miR-140 is always sufficient to prevent an increase in <italic>SMAD3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). If we assume miR-140 is absent, then after activation of TGF-&#x003b2;, there is an increase in <italic>SMAD3</italic> transcription and translation and therefore a higher peak in phospho-SMAD3 although the duration of the signalling response is not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). This suggests that miR-140 only acts to dampen the initial response.</p><fig id="pone.0187568.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0187568.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Model of the involvement of miR-140 in SMAD3 signalling.</title><p><bold>A</bold>, Network motif showing positive feedback. <bold>B</bold>, Diagram of full model. <bold>C</bold>-<bold>D,</bold> Output from one stochastic simulation with miR-140 present (miR140 = 500 initially, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>synmiR140</italic></sub> = 0.0018 s<sup>-1</sup>) (C) or without miR-140 (miR140 = 0 initially, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>synmiR140</italic></sub> = 0.0 s<sup>-1</sup>) <bold>D</bold>.

It inhibits RUNX2, a transcription factor that inhibits chondrocyte proliferation, up-regulates the matrix-degrading enzyme, <italic>MMP13</italic>, and promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. SOX9 inhibits RUNX2 by promoting its degradation [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. HDAC4 also inhibits RUNX2 by binding to its promoter and inhibiting transcription. In addition, HDAC4 binds to RUNX2 protein to inhibit its transcriptional activity. A target of SOX9 is miR-140 [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which has been shown to inhibit HDAC4 [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since HDAC4 inhibits RUNX2, the overall effect is that miR-140 activates RUNX2. Therefore SOX9 directly inhibits RUNX2 but also indirectly activates RUNX2 via miR-140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This is an example of an incoherent feedforward loop, but note that this has different features to the motif described above. In the generic model, a TF directly activated a target but indirectly inhibited the target via a miRNA. In this example, a TF (SOX9) directly inhibits a target (RUNX2) and indirectly activates it via a miRNA (miR-140). Therefore, we would not expect a pulse-like response but would expect miR-140 to have a moderating effect on RUNX2 inhibition. We constructed a simple model, where we assumed that SOX9 up-regulates miR-140, miR-140 binds to <italic>HDAC4</italic> mRNA to inhibit its translation, HDAC4 protein binds to RUNX2 to inhibit its activity and also binds to the <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene to inhibit transcription, and SOX9 promotes the degradation of RUNX2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Hence SOX9 directly inhibits RUNX2 but also has a delayed response whereby it activates RUNX2. Therefore, we would predict that on activation of SOX9, RUNX2 levels would decline, but after up-regulation of miR-140, pools of RUNX2 would stabilise. The model output shows this behaviour as RUNX2 levels decline in the presence of SOX9, but the increase in miR-140 leads to a slight recovery in RUNX2 levels and so <italic>MMP13</italic> levels increase slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). In the absence of miR-140, RUNX2 declines to very low levels and so no <italic>MMP13</italic> is produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Therefore miR-140 moderates the response of RUNX2 to SOX9, raising the steady-state level of RUNX2.</p><fig id="pone.0187568.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0187568.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Model of the involvement of miR-140 in SOX9-dependent regulation of RUNX2.</title><p><bold>A</bold>, Network motif showing incoherent feedforward loop. <bold>B</bold>, Diagram of full model. <bold>C</bold>-<bold>D</bold>, Output from one stochastic simulation, <bold>C,</bold> with miR-140 (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>synmiR140</italic></sub> = 0.0018 s<sup>-1</sup>) or <bold>D</bold>, without miR-140 (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>synmiR140</italic></sub> = 0.0 s<sup>-1</sup>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0187568.g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>A model of miR-140 in the IL-1 pathway&#x02013;a coherent feedforward loop</title><p>The cytokine IL-1 activates signalling pathways that lead to up-regulation of catabolic genes such as <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>MMP13</italic> and <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

As levels of aggrecan and collagen2 fragments are low, the same combination of IL-1 and TGF-&#x003b2; can produce different levels of fragments in repeated simulations. Therefore, each combination of initial conditions was simulated 100 times and the mean and 95% confidence interval of the mean was plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The model output shows that both aggrecan and collagen2 fragments increase with increasing levels of IL-1 with much higher levels when miR-140 is inhibited. Increasing TGF-&#x003b2; has no effect on aggrecan degradation but significantly decreases collagen degradation when miR-140 is not inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>). However, when miR-140 is inhibited, increasing TGF-&#x003b2; leads to a slight increase in aggrecan fragments, when IL-1 &#x0003e; 700, but a significant decrease in collagen fragments and also delays the threshold level of IL-1 at which collagen fragments appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g009">Fig 9C and 9D</xref>).

Each model represented a biological network consisting of key components such as transcription factors, miRNAs, and target genes and a set of reactions to describe how the components interact. The generic models showed how different motifs lead to different behaviours such as bistability (positive feedback), oscillatory behaviour (negative feedback), longer lasting responses (coherent feedforward), and pulse-like responses (incoherent feedforward). We then identified some of these motifs in pathways involving miR-140 in the context of OA. Several studies have reported the effect of miR-140 on a number of different targets that are important in OA [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The aim of this study was to demonstrate how models can be built based on bioinformatics analysis and experimental data and then to show how different findings can be integrated. We constructed five different models and identified five different network motifs: positive feedback (miR-140/<italic>SMAD3</italic>); coherent feedforward (IL1/miR-140/<italic>ADAMTS5</italic>); and three types of incoherent feedforward motifs (SOX9/miR-140/RUNX2), (IL1/miR-140/<italic>MMP13</italic>), and (TNF-&#x003b1;/miR-140/<italic>IGFBP5</italic>). We showed that miR-140 has both positive and negative effects on cartilage. On the one hand, it inhibits translation of two major cartilage degrading enzymes, MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5. On the other hand, miR-140 reduces both IGF-1 and TGF-&#x003b2; signalling so that potentially less cartilage components are transcribed and, in addition, increases activation of RUNX2, which leads to up-regulation of <italic>MMP13</italic>. To examine the overall effect of miR-140, we combined the five models, and this model suggested that the overall effect of miR-140 would be beneficial. This agrees with observations that miR-140 is down-regulated in OA [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, there are many other components in the different pathways of the integrated model that were omitted for simplicity in this model. Moreover, at the present state of knowledge in the field, it is quite likely that there exist relevant processes regulated by miR-140 that are currently unknown. Also, the integrated model was based on published data from different sources; some more complete than others, having, for example, different time resolutions and different experimental protocols. For all these reasons further experimental studies are required to explicitly validate parts of the network before we can have complete confidence in the integrated model&#x02019;s overall behaviour. As the model is encoded in SBML, it will be possible to remove or amend parts of the network if future studies show that the current data is not robust. It will also be straight forward to add in more detail of other important mechanisms, as data become available, to produce a model that can make testable predictions.</p><p>Many miRNAs, including miR-140 have been shown to be involved in chondrogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Barter <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] identified miR-140 and miR-455 as having an important role, with the effects of miR-140 being predominantly mediated by the miR-140-5p strand. As well as confirming many previously identified targets, they identified a new target in the Wnt signalling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition to modelling the effects of miRNAs in OA, the modelling approach described in this paper is currently being used to produce a computer simulation model of the regulatory pathways involving miRNAs in chondrogenesis. This would provide a useful tool to examine different interventions, to increase the efficiency of <italic>in vitro</italic> chondrogenesis.</p><p>Network motifs in biological systems have been extensively studied and modelled by Alon [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. He found that some motifs are particularly common in transcriptional networks, such as the incoherent type-1 feedforward loop. There are four different incoherent feedforward loops as each of the interactions between the nodes can be either activation or repression; a type-1 loop corresponds to the arrangement shown in Figure Fi of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187568.s001">S1 File</xref>. Alon [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] showed that this type of motif produces pulse-like behaviour and our model of the IL1/miR-140/<italic>MMP13</italic> interactions also resulted in a pulse of <italic>MMP13</italic> in the presence of miR-140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). In our model of SOX9/miR-140/RUNX2 interactions, our incoherent network is rather different from any of the networks studied by Alon [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] in that one of the branches is three steps long rather than two. This gives it the features of two feedforward loops (a type-2 incoherent loop, with two inhibitory reactions centred on HDAC4, and a type-3 incoherent loop, with two activating reactions centred on miR-140). The type-2 incoherent loop is responsive to its internal signal (HDAC4) and tends to act to accelerate an off signal (switching off RUNX2), which is a desirable feature in the regulation of cartilage degradation. Alon [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] found that type-3 incoherent loops are uncommon and suggested that this was due to the poor sensitivity of the network to inputs at its internal node. In our model, this internal node corresponds to miR-140, which has the potential to increase activation of RUNX2 and hence <italic>MMP13</italic>. It may be that this lack of sensitivity explains why in the combined model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187568.g008">Fig 8</xref>), the inhibitory effects of miR-140 seem to overcome its potentially activating effect through RUNX2.</p><p>Other miRNAs have also been shown to play a role in OA, including miR-9, -98, -146 and -455 (reviewed in Le e<italic>t al</italic>. 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) and more recent studies have added to the ever-growing list, e.g., miR-3085 [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The bioinformatics analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187568.s002">S2 File</xref>) suggests that other miRNAs such as miR-200c-3p -21-5p, -29b-3p, -100-5p and 200b-3p may also be worth further investigation. Interestingly, a recent study showed that miR-200b-3p inhibits expression of <italic>DNMT3A</italic> resulting in lower expression of the matrix degrading enzymes <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>MMP3</italic>, <italic>MMP9</italic> and <italic>MMP13 [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</italic> In addition, another recent study examined the miR-29 family (including miR-29b-3p) in cartilage and identified a complex network of interactions between miR-29 and TGF-&#x003b2;, NF&#x003ba;B, and WNT signalling [<xref rid="pone.0187568.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Both these studies were too recent to be included in the latest version of miRTarBase, confirming the usefulness of our bioinformatics analysis for discovering new potential targets. However, even this approach has limitations due to the time-lag between the publication of new studies and the updating of the databases. This problem was demonstrated when we carried out a search of the role of miR-200c-3p (the miRNA that was most enriched for OA targets), as this revealed other targets important in OA that were not present in Open Targets. Despite this, the analysis provides a good starting point to suggest further research into miRNAs that are currently over-looked in OA research. In identifying novel OA-associated miRNAs, we adopted the approach that miRNAs associated with cartilage development or remodelling in disease would be likely to have OA-associated genes enriched among their targets. This could be criticised for a number of reasons: the effectiveness of the approach will depend on the completeness and accuracy of annotation of the targets of a miRNA and OA related genes; OA-related genes may have multiple functions, and it may be in a different biological role that a particular miRNA is regulating them; and finally a miRNA could still be important in cartilage homeostasis or the development of OA while regulating just a few crucial genes. We also stress that focussing on particular miRNAs can lead to bias, e.g., miR-140 is known to play a role in OA but this has led to many studies of variable quality that may be over-emphasising its importance over other miRNAs. Therefore, future work should focus on validating potentially novel miRNAs that have been discovered using unbiased approaches. We carried out a search in PubMed to investigate which miRNAs from our bioinformatics analysis are novel for OA. This showed that miR-200c-3p, miR-100-5p, and miR-1826 are all good candidates for future validation. Lastly it is well-known that individual miRNAs have fairly small effects on gene expression, but many genes are regulated by many different miRNAs (referred to as miRNA target hubs) and/or have multiple sites of regulation and, so, including multiple miRNAs will lead to stronger repression of targets.
