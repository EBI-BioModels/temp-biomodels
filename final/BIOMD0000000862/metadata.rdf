    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The aim of this study was to show how computational models
    can be used to increase our understanding of the role of
    microRNAs in osteoarthritis (OA) using miR-140 as an example.
    Bioinformatics analysis and experimental results from the
    literature were used to create and calibrate models of gene
    regulatory networks in OA involving miR-140 along with key
    regulators such as NF-?B, SMAD3, and RUNX2. The individual
    models were created with the modelling standard, Systems
    Biology Markup Language, and integrated to examine the overall
    effect of miR-140 on cartilage homeostasis. Down-regulation of
    miR-140 may have either detrimental or protective effects for
    cartilage, indicating that the role of miR-140 is complex.
    Studies of individual networks in isolation may therefore lead
    to different conclusions. This indicated the need to combine
    the five chosen individual networks involving miR-140 into an
    integrated model. This model suggests that the overall effect
    of miR-140 is to change the response to an IL-1 stimulus from a
    prolonged increase in matrix degrading enzymes to a pulse-like
    response so that cartilage degradation is temporary. Our
    current model can easily be modified and extended as more
    experimental data become available about the role of miR-140 in
    OA. In addition, networks of other microRNAs that are important
    in OA could be incorporated. A fully integrated model could not
    only aid our understanding of the mechanisms of microRNAs in
    ageing cartilage but could also provide a useful tool to
    investigate the effect of potential interventions to prevent
    cartilage loss.</p>
