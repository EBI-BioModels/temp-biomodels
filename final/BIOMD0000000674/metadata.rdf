hepatic polyamine and sulfur aminoacid metabolism - version1</div>
  <div class="dc:description">
    <p>Mammalian polyamine metabolism consists of a bi-cycle with two
  required entrances, omithine and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), and
  several alternative exists. The relevant regulatory roles of the
  short half-life enzymes ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), S-adenosyl
  methione decarboxylase (SAMDC) and spermindine/spermine acetyl
  transferase (SSAT) in polyamine metabolism are well studied, and
  has been modelled here.</p>

    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Many molecular details remain to be uncovered concerning the
    regulation of polyamine metabolism. A previous model of
    mammalian polyamine metabolism showed that S-adenosyl
    methionine availability could play a key role in polyamine
    homeostasis. To get a deeper insight in this prediction, we
    have built a combined model by integration of the previously
    published polyamine model and one-carbon and glutathione
    metabolism model, published by different research groups. The
    combined model is robust and it is able to achieve
    physiological steady-state values, as well as to reproduce the
    predictions of the individual models. Furthermore, a transition
    between two versions of our model with new regulatory factors
    added properly simulates the switch in methionine adenosyl
    transferase isozymes occurring when the liver enters in
    proliferative conditions. The combined model is useful to
    support the previous prediction on the role of S-adenosyl
    methionine availability in polyamine homeostasis. Furthermore,
    it could be easily adapted to get deeper insights on the
    connections of polyamines with energy metabolism.</p>
