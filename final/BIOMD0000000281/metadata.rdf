          Abstract:      &lt;br/&gt;
          The other papers of this series present experimental
evidence for possible relationships between the kinetics of oxygen,
glucose, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine triphosphate, and
phosphate and those of the cytochromes and pyridine nucleotides
of the ascites tumor cell. From these general experiments we
are able to formulate, under the law of mass action, a minimum
hypothesis under which the four metabolic regulations previously
described can be observed. In brief, the system can be represented by the known enzyme systems, a relatively higher ADP affinity in respiration than in glycolysis, the mitochondrial membrane, a segregation of ATP into two compartments, and an ATP-utilizing system that is responsive to small decreases of the intracellular ADP level. The chemical equations for the pathway from glucose to oxygen are solved by a digital computer method so that the responses of the chemical equations and of the living cell can be accurately compared.      &lt;br/&gt;
          For reasons already described, we greatly prefer a com-
puter representation based upon a physical or chemical law
representing the action of the system to a model simulating the
operation of the chemical system but not based upon funda-
mental laws for the reactions involved; such a representation
would not adequately represent the kinetics of the system, as in
an electric circuit network or in some types of hydraulic ana-
logues.      &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The model gives solutions of the reaction kinetics for three types of metabolism:      &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;0 - 64s, metabolism of endogenous substrate&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;64s - 119s, metabolism of added glucose, illustrating the activated and inhibited aspects of glucose metabolism&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;119s - 153s, relief of glucose and oxygen inhibition by the addition of an uncoupling agent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
