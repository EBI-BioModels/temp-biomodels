  <div class="dc:title">NguyenLK2011 - Ubiquitination dynamics in
Ring1B-Bmi1 system</div>
  <div class="dc:description">This theoretical model investigates the
dynamics of Ring1B/Bmi1 ubiquitination to identify bistable
switch-like and oscillatory behaviour in the
system. Michaelis-Menten (MM) equations are used to formulate
the model. However, the authors show that the dynamics persist even
for Mass-Action kinetics. This SBML file is the MM version of the
model.</div>

    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>In an active, self-ubiquitinated state, the Ring1B ligase
    monoubiquitinates histone H2A playing a critical role in
    Polycomb-mediated gene silencing. Following ubiquitination by
    external ligases, Ring1B is targeted for proteosomal
    degradation. Using biochemical data and computational modeling,
    we show that the Ring1B ligase can exhibit abrupt switches,
    overshoot transitions and self-perpetuating oscillations
    between its distinct ubiquitination and activity states. These
    different Ring1B states display canonical or multiply branched,
    atypical polyubiquitin chains and involve association with the
    Polycomb-group protein Bmi1. Bistable switches and oscillations
    may lead to all-or-none histone H2A monoubiquitination rates
    and result in discrete periods of gene (in)activity. Switches,
    overshoots and oscillations in Ring1B catalytic activity and
    proteosomal degradation are controlled by the abundances of
    Bmi1 and Ring1B, and the activities and abundances of external
    ligases and deubiquitinases, such as E6-AP and USP7.</p>
