    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The phosphotransferase system (PTS) is the sugar
    transportation machinery that is widely distributed in
    prokaryotes and is critical for enhanced production of useful
    metabolites. To increase the glucose uptake rate, we propose a
    rational strategy for designing the molecular architecture of
    the Escherichia coli glucose PTS by using a computer-aided
    design (CAD) system and verified the simulated results with
    biological experiments. CAD supports construction of a
    biochemical map, mathematical modeling, simulation, and system
    analysis. Assuming that the PTS aims at controlling the glucose
    uptake rate, the PTS was decomposed into hierarchical modules,
    functional and flux modules, and the effect of changes in gene
    expression on the glucose uptake rate was simulated to make a
    rational strategy of how the gene regulatory network is
    engineered. Such design and analysis predicted that the mlc
    knockout mutant with ptsI gene overexpression would greatly
    increase the specific glucose uptake rate. By using biological
    experiments, we validated the prediction and the presented
    strategy, thereby enhancing the specific glucose uptake
    rate.</p>
