    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Our understanding of the complex, transcriptional feedback
    loops in the circadian clock mechanism has depended upon
    quantitative, timeseries data from disparate sources. We
    measure clock gene RNA profiles in Arabidopsis thaliana
    seedlings, grown with or without exogenous sucrose, or in
    soil-grown plants and in wild-type and mutant backgrounds. The
    RNA profiles were strikingly robust across the experimental
    conditions, so current mathematical models are likely to be
    broadly applicable in leaf tissue. In addition to providing
    reference data, unexpected behaviours included co-expression of
    PRR9 and ELF4, and regulation of PRR5 by GI. Absolute RNA
    quantification revealed low levels of PRR9 transcripts (peak
    approx. 50 copies cell(-1)) compared with other clock genes,
    and threefold higher levels of LHY RNA (more than 1500 copies
    cell(-1)) than of its close relative CCA1. The data are
    disseminated from BioDare, an online repository for focused
    timeseries data, which is expected to benefit mechanistic
    modelling. One data subset successfully constrained clock gene
    expression in a complex model, using publicly available
    software on parallel computers, without expert tuning or
    programming. We outline the empirical and mathematical
    justification for data aggregation in understanding highly
    interconnected, dynamic networks such as the clock, and the
    observed design constraints on the resources required to make
    this approach widely accessible.</p>
