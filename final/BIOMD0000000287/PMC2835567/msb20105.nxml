Senescence contributes both to age-related loss of tissue homeostasis, as the loss of division capacity leads to impaired cell renewal, and also to protect against cancer, because it acts to block the uncontrolled proliferation of cells that may give rise to a malignant tumour. Replicative senescence is triggered by uncapped telomeres or by &#x02018;unrepairable' non-telomeric DNA damage. Both lesions initiate the same canonical DNA damage response (DDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">d'Adda di Fagagna, 2008</xref>). This response is characterized by activation of sensor kinases (ATM/ATR, DNA-PK), formation of DNA damage foci containing activated H2A.X (&#x003b3;H2A.X) and ultimately induction of cell cycle arrest through activation of checkpoint proteins, notably p53 (TP53) and the CDK inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A). This signalling pathway continues to contribute actively to the stability of the G0 arrest in fully senescent cells long after induction of senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">d'Adda di Fagagna et al, 2003</xref>). However, senescence is more complex than mere CDKI-mediated growth arrest. Senescent cells alter their expression of literally hundreds of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Shelton et al, 1999</xref>), prominent among these being pro-inflammatory secretory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Coppe et al, 2008</xref>) and marker genes for a retrograde response induced by mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Passos et al, 2007a</xref>).</p><p>There is a growing evidence that multiple mechanisms interact to underpin ageing at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kirkwood, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Passos et al, 2007b</xref>) necessitating a systems biology approach if the complex mechanisms of ageing are to be understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kirkwood, 2008</xref>). With respect to cell senescence, the two major unanswered questions are (i) How does a DNA lesion that can be repaired, at least in principle, induce and maintain irreversible growth arrest? and (ii) How does a growth arrest trigger a completely different cellular phenotype as soon as it becomes irreversible?</p><p>To understand those questions, we performed a kinetic analysis of the establishment phase of senescence initiated by DNA damage or telomere dysfunction, focussing on pathways downstream of the classical DDR. Using an approach that combined (i) <italic>in-silico</italic> interactome analysis, (ii) functional target gene inhibition, (iii) stochastic modelling, and (iv) live cell microscopy, we identified a positive feedback loop between DDR and mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as necessary and sufficient for long-term maintenance of growth arrest. Using pathway log likelihood scores calculated by a quantitative <italic>in-silico</italic> interactome analysis to guide siRNA and small molecule inhibition experiments, and using results of sequential and combined inhibition experiments to refine the predictions from the interactome analysis, we found that DDR triggered mitochondrial dysfunction leading to enhanced ROS activation through a linear signal transduction through TP53, CDKN1A, GADD45A, p38 (MAPK14), GRB2, TGFBR2 and TGF&#x003b2;(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). We hypothesized that these ROS stochastically generate novel DNA damage in the nucleus, thus forming a positive feedback loop contributing to the long-term maintenance of DDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). First confirmation came from static inhibitor experiments as before, showing that nuclear DNA damage foci frequencies in senescent cells were reduced if feedback signalling was suppressed. To formally establish the existence of a feedback loop and its relevance for senescence, we used live cell microscopy in combination with quantitative modelling.</p><p>We transformed the conceptual model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref> into a stochastic mechanistic model of the DDR feedback loop by extending the previously published model of the TP53/Mdm2 circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Proctor and Gray, 2008</xref>) to include reactions for synthesis/activation and degradation/deactivation/repair of CDKN1A, GADD45, MAPK14, ROS and DNA damage. The model replicated very precisely the kinetic behaviour of activated TP53, CDKN1A, ROS and DNA damage foci after initiation of senescence by irradiation. Having established its concordance with the experimental data, the model was then used to predict the effects of intervening in the feedback loop. The model predicted that any intervention reducing ROS levels by about half would decrease average DNA damage foci frequencies from six to four foci/nucleus within about 15&#x02009;h. It further predicted that this would be sufficient to reduce CDKN1A to basal levels continuously for at least 6&#x02009;h in about 20&#x00025; of the treated cells, thus allowing a significant fraction of cells to escape from growth arrest and to resume proliferation. This should happen even if the intervention into the feedback loop was started at a late time point (e.g. 6 days) after induction of senescence.</p><p>To analyse DNA damage foci dynamics we used a reporter construct (AcGFP&#x02013;53BP1c) that quantitatively reports single DNA damage foci kinetics in time-resolved live cell microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Nelson et al, 2009</xref>). Foci frequency measurements quantitatively confirmed the prediction from the stochastic model. More importantly, we found that many individual foci in both telomere- and stress-dependent senescence had short lifespans with half-lives below 15&#x02009;h. Feedback loop inhibition reduced only the frequencies of short-lived DNA damage foci in accordance with the hypothesis that ROS production contributed to DDR by constant replenishment of short-lived DNA damage foci.</p><p>Finally, we inhibited signalling through the loop at different time points after induction of senescence by ionizing radiation and measured ROS levels, DNA damage foci frequencies and proliferation markers. Treatments with the MAPK14 inhibitor SB203580 or the free radical scavenger PBN were used to block the loop. The results quantitatively confirmed the model prediction and indicated that the feedback loop between DDR and ROS production was both necessary and sufficient to maintain cell cycle arrest for at least 6&#x02013;10 days after induction of senescence. Interestingly, the loop was still active at later time points and in deep senescence, but proliferation arrest was then stabilized by additional factor(s). This indicated that certain features of the senescent phenotype-like ROS production that might be responsible for the negative impact of senescent cells into their tissue environment can be successfully inhibited even in deep senescence. This may prove relevant for novel therapeutic studies aiming to modulate intracellular ROS levels in both aging and cancer.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Cellular senescence&#x02014;the permanent arrest of cycling in normally proliferating cells such as fibroblasts&#x02014;contributes both to age-related loss of mammalian tissue homeostasis and acts as a tumour suppressor mechanism. The pathways leading to establishment of senescence are proving to be more complex than was previously envisaged. Combining <italic>in-silico</italic> interactome analysis and functional target gene inhibition, stochastic modelling and live cell microscopy, we show here that there exists a dynamic feedback loop that is triggered by a DNA damage response (DDR) and, which after a delay of several days, locks the cell into an actively maintained state of &#x02018;deep' cellular senescence. The essential feature of the loop is that long-term activation of the checkpoint gene CDKN1A (p21) induces mitochondrial dysfunction and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through serial signalling through GADD45-MAPK14(p38MAPK)-GRB2-TGFBR2-TGF&#x003b2;. These ROS in turn replenish short-lived DNA damage foci and maintain an ongoing DDR. We show that this loop is both necessary and sufficient for the stability of growth arrest during the establishment of the senescent phenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>cell senescence</kwd><kwd>DNA damage foci</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular senescence is defined by the irreversible loss of division potential of somatic cells and a variety of associated phenotypic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007</xref>).

This response is characterized by activation of sensor kinases (ATM/ATR, DNA-PK), formation of DNA damage foci containing activated H2A.X (&#x003b3;H2A.X) and ultimately induction of cell cycle arrest through activation of checkpoint proteins, notably p53 (TP53) and the CDK inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A). This signalling pathway continues to contribute actively to the stability of the G0 arrest in fully senescent cells long after induction of senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">d'Adda di Fagagna et al, 2003</xref>). However, interruption of this pathway is no longer sufficient to rescue growth once the cells have progressed towards an established senescent phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">d'Adda di Fagagna et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Sang et al, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Senescence is clearly more complex than CDKI-mediated growth arrest: senescent cells express hundreds of genes differentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Shelton et al, 1999</xref>), prominent among these being pro-inflammatory secretory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Coppe et al, 2008</xref>) and marker genes for a retrograde response induced by mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Passos et al, 2007a</xref>). Recent studies showed that activated chemokine receptor CXCR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Acosta et al, 2008</xref>), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Wajapeyee et al, 2008</xref>), IL6 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kuilman et al, 2008</xref>) or downregulation of the transcriptional repressor HES1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Sang et al, 2008</xref>) may be required for the establishment and/or maintenance of the senescent phenotype in various cell types. A signature pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype takes 7&#x02013;10 days to develop under DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Coppe et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Rodier et al, 2009</xref>). Together, these data suggest that senescence develops quite slowly from an initiation stage (e.g. DDR-mediated cell cycle arrest) towards fully irreversible, phenotypically complete senescence. It is the intermediary step(s) that define the establishment of senescence, which are largely unknown with respect to kinetics and governing mechanisms.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are likely to be involved in establishment and stabilization of senescence: elevated ROS levels are associated with both replicative (telomere-dependent) and stress- or oncogene-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Saretzki et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Ramsey and Sharpless, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Passos et al, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Lu and Finkel, 2008</xref>). ROS accelerate telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">von Zglinicki, 2002</xref>) and can damage DNA directly and thus induce DDR and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chen et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Lu and Finkel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Rai et al, 2008</xref>). Conversely, activation of the major downstream effectors of the DDR/senescence checkpoint can induce ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Polyak et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Macip et al, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2003</xref>). Thus, cause&#x02013;effect relationships between cellular ROS production and senescence are not sufficiently clear.</p><p>Here, we analyse the role of ROS for the establishment of senescence initiated by DNA damage or telomere dysfunction and show the existence of a positive feedback loop between DDR and ROS production. We show that telomere-dependent or -independent DDR triggers mitochondrial dysfunction leading to enhanced ROS activation through a linear signal transduction through TP53, CDKN1A, GADD45A, p38 (MAPK14), GRB2, TGFBR2 and TGF&#x003b2;. ROS contribute in a stochastic manner to the long-term maintenance of DNA damage foci, and this is necessary and sufficient to maintain proliferation arrest in response to DNA damage during the establishment of an irreversible senescent phenotype. Our results provide experimental evidence that ROS-dependent signalling is required for the establishment of irreversible senescence of cells with dysfunctional telomeres or damaged DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. This result might be relevant for therapeutic studies aiming to modulate intracellular ROS levels in both aging and cancer.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Delayed mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production are a consequence of senescence</title><p>To measure the kinetics of ROS induction in senescence, we treated proliferation-competent human MRC5 fibroblasts with ionizing radiation (IR, 20 Gy). This abolished cell growth and labelling indices for BrdU, Ki67 and caused expression of senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase (Sen-&#x003b2;-Gal) to an extent equal to the deep replicative senescence seen when cells had reached their normal proliferative limit (data not shown; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S1A and B</xref>). After IR, DNA damage foci frequencies remained permanently elevated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S1C&#x02013;E</xref>) but did not co-localize with telomeres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1F</xref>), together indicating that the cells were driven into stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS). Importantly, the levels of mitochondrial superoxide (measured as MitoSOX fluorescence intensity in flow cytometry) and cellular peroxides (dihydrorhodamine 123/DHR fluorescence intensity) did not alter immediately after IR but after 24 h the levels of both ROS indicators increased and remained elevated over the entire observation period from day 2 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). This delayed change in ROS indicators was accompanied by a corresponding increase in mitochondrial mass measured by nonyl acridine orange (NAO) fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential measured by JC-1 (5,5&#x02032;,6,6&#x02032;-tetrachloro-1,1&#x02032;,3,3&#x02032;-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanide iodide) fluorescence (MMP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). This was further associated with increased transcription of <italic>UCP-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1G</xref>), which codes for the main uncoupling protein in human fibroblasts. The proton leak-dependent (oligomycin resistant) oxygen uptake increased about two-fold after IR-mediated arrest, similar to deep replicative senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming mitochondrial uncoupling as an early event after DDR. Loss of MMP under DDR was also reflected by a diminished ability to maintain cellular [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>To see whether ROS production would also be induced in telomere-dependent senescence, we conditionally overexpressed a dominant-negative version of the telomere-binding protein TRF2 (TRF2<sup>&#x00394;B&#x00394;M</sup>) by doxycycline removal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S3A&#x02013;C</xref>). This induced purely telomere-dependent senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">van Steensel et al, 1998</xref>) and resulted in comparable kinetics of appearance of mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production as well as loss of growth potential and induction of DNA damage foci containing activated H2AX (&#x003b3;H2AX, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D and E;</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S3D&#x02013;G</xref>). Antioxidant treatment (growth of cells under low ambient oxygen and under treatment with the free radical scavenger PBN) reduced, but did not abolish DNA damage foci induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3H</xref>). Retroviral transduction of TRF2<sup>&#x00394;B&#x00394;M</sup> into primary human MRC5 fibroblasts also induced a similar response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Decreased MMP coupled with increased ROS levels is a hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction that has recently been observed in senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Passos et al, 2007a</xref>). Our data now show that mitochondrial dysfunction is a delayed result of DDR regardless of how this is caused. We reasoned that such elevated ROS production might in turn contribute to DNA damage and DDR, thus forming a positive feedback loop.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of a signalling pathway that induces ROS production and maintains DDR as part of a positive feedback loop</title><p>To test this idea and to delineate the signalling pathway between DDR and mitochondrial dysfunction/ROS production, we first modulated <italic>TP53</italic> levels in MRC5 human fibroblasts and measured both ROS levels and DNA damage foci frequencies.

This is in accordance with recent data showing that TP53 is not necessary for the DDR-dependent induction of senescence-associated interleukine secretion in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Rodier et al, 2009</xref>). There is also published evidence that TGF&#x003b2; and p38 (MAPK14) activation can induce cellular ROS production through mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial (NADPHoxidase-dependent) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Torres and Forman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Koli et al, 2008</xref>).

We calculated the log likelihood score (LLS) of each pathway as the average of the LLS for each individual interaction involved. The 20 most probable pathways are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>. Note that many of the interactions in Biogrid do not have an inherent directionality, so the resulting network is undirected. Path analysis therefore identified a number of false positive candidate pathways. However, all of the most probable pathways revealed a central position for the CDKN1A target gene GADD45A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). GADD45A binds directly to CDKN1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kearsey et al, 1995</xref>) and can activate MAPK14 both indirectly (through MAP3K4 and MAP2K3) and directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bulavin et al, 2003</xref>).</p><p>To analyse experimentally the role of GADD45A and the hierarchy of MAPK14 and TGF&#x003b2;, we performed further sequential candidate inhibitions, both singly and in various combinations. All treatments reduced ROS formation and DDR by a similar amount, and there was no additive effect for any of the combined treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>), strongly suggesting that all tested gene products are members of one single epistatic pathway. Calculation of LLS in alternative pathways suggested that the probability for MAPK14 being upstream of TGF&#x003b2; is about two orders of magnitude higher than for its being downstream (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The most probable pathway according to the interactome analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>. Overlaying the genes in these pathways with the results of an Affymetrix gene expression analysis of MRC5 fibroblast senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Passos et al, 2007a</xref>), we noted that the central genes in this pathway tend to be co-ordinately upregulated in senescent human fibroblasts, resulting in a tight cluster when subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). We further confirmed signalling through CDKN1A-MAPK14-TGF&#x003b2; as part of a positive feedback loop combining DDR and ROS production by showing that (i) inhibition of MAPK14 reduced the amount of secreted TGF&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S9A</xref>), increased MMP and decreased mitochondrial mass after IR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S9B</xref>); (ii) inhibition of either MAPK14 or TGF&#x003b2; or both reduced DNA damage foci containing activated ATM/ATR and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>); (iii) treatment with the MAPK14 inhibitor SB203580 lowered the levels of activated TP53 (p53-S15), CDKN1A and phosphorylated MAPK14 itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>); (iv) inhibition of MAPK14, but not of arachidonic acid metabolism, cytochrome P450 or PI3K signalling, specifically diminished the rise in ROS levels in telomere-dependent senescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>); (v) inhibition of MAPK14 and TGF&#x003b2;, alone or in combination, reduced nuclear CDKN1A levels in MRC5 fibroblasts after IR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S13A</xref>); and (vi) scavenging of ROS reduced DDR foci frequencies and CDKN1A induction after IR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S13B</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data strongly suggested that the DDR and ultimately growth arrest in senescent cells might be maintained by a positive feedback loop between DDR and mitochondrial dysfunction/ROS production through signalling through TP53-CDKN1A-GADD45A-MAPK14-GRB2-TGFBRII-TGF&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A stochastic feedback loop model predicts the kinetics of DDR and growth arrest at the single cell level</title><p>We quantified the conceptual model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref> to see whether it could sufficiently explain the kinetics of senescence induction and maintenance. To create a stochastic mechanistic model of the DDR feedback loop, we extended our previously published model of the TP53/Mdm2 circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Proctor and Gray, 2008</xref>) to include reactions for synthesis/activation and degradation/deactivation/repair of CDKN1A, GADD45, MAPK14, ROS and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S3</xref>). We chose realistic values for reaction rate constants and the initial amounts of the variables (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S3</xref>) and ran stochastic simulations for 500 cells initially from 2 days before until 6 days after IR. We parameterized the model using experimental kinetic data for TP53-S15, CDKN1A and MAPK14 protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>), DNA damage foci frequencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1E</xref>) and ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4A</xref>). The model replicated very precisely the kinetic behaviour of activated TP53, CDKN1A, ROS and DNA damage foci after irradiation. In simulations, the key variables stabilized after 2&#x02013;3 days such that CDKN1A levels were maintained sufficiently above background to generate a stable growth arrest phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, a model without feedback would always return in less than 2&#x02013;3 days to pre-irradiation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Having established its concordance with the experimental data, the model was then used to predict the effects of intervening in the feedback loop. Suppression of MAPK14 signalling or antioxidant treatment at day 6 after IR reduced ROS levels by about half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). The model predicted significantly decreased DDR and, importantly, reduced CDKN1A levels to an extent that would allow a fraction of cells to escape from growth arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, the model predicts that a feedback loop is both necessary and sufficient for the stability of growth arrest after induction of senescence by DNA damage.</p><p>At higher time resolution, the model predicted a significant decline in DDR foci frequencies in IR-arrested cells within a few hours after MAPK14 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). To test this prediction, we used a 53BP1&#x02013;GFP fusion protein as DDR reporter in live cells. 53BP1 is ubiquitously expressed and homogeneously distributed throughout the nucleus, and redistributes into foci after DNA damage. We fused a large C-terminal fragment of 53BP1, containing both the TUDOR and BRCT domains necessary for focus formation and interaction with TP53, to GFP, producing an AcGFP&#x02013;53BP1c fusion protein that quantitatively reported foci dynamics in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Nelson et al, 2009</xref>). DNA damage foci frequencies and levels of activated p53, CDKN1A and ROS all stabilized at around 2 days after IR and remained so over the following days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1E</xref>). Therefore, we visualized individual MRC5 fibroblasts stably expressing AcGFP&#x02013;53BP1c from 3 day till up to 5 day after IR-mediated arrest. While under observation, the cells were treated with the MAPK14 inhibitor SB203580 at 94 h. Time-resolved live cell microscopy allowed the qualitative and quantitative identification of individual DNA damage foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie SM1</xref>). Foci frequency measurements were in good agreement with static measurements by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S10B</xref>) and quantitatively confirmed the prediction from the stochastic model (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D and F</xref>).</p><p>Closer observation of the time series revealed that the lifespan of many individual foci was much shorter than the observation period (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie SM1</xref>). We ensured proper tracking of individual foci by using a wide z-stack range (4.5 &#x003bc;m) and a high imaging frequency (every 7 min). Appearance or disappearance, respectively, of foci on at least two consecutive images was used as recording criterion.</p><p>We measured the lifespan of individual foci in young proliferating, irradiated and deep senescent MRC5 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3G</xref>). There were few foci in proliferating cells, most of them with lifespans below 5 h, probably caused by replication stress. Foci lifespan increased significantly in senescent cells. However, even in deep telomere-dependent replicative senescence not all foci became permanent. Rather, about half of all foci were short lived with lifespans below 15 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3G</xref>). Foci kinetics at &#x0003e;2 day after IR was very similar to that in replicative senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3G</xref>). Individual cell traces revealed that the reduction of total foci frequencies under SB203580 treatment was preferentially because of lower numbers of short-lived foci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S14</xref>). Using a lifespan of 15 h as cut-off, we found a significant decrease in the frequency of short-lived, but not long-lived foci as a result of SB203580 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3H</xref>). These data show that ROS production, mediated by a delayed signalling through MAPK14, contributes to DDR by constant replenishment of short-lived DNA damage foci.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The feedback loop between DDR and ROS production is necessary and sufficient to maintain senescent growth arrest during establishment of irreversible senescence</title><p>To analyse the relevance of the feedback loop for establishment and maintenance of the senescent phenotype we inhibited signalling through the loop at different time points after induction of SIPS by IR and measured ROS levels, DNA damage foci frequencies and proliferation markers. Treatments with the MAPK14 inhibitor SB203580 or the free radical scavenger PBN were used to block the loop, and a time frame from 30 min until 21 days after IR as well as deep replicative senescence was experimentally covered. Own (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>) and published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Coppe et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Rodier et al, 2009</xref>) data indicated that a full senescent phenotype develops over 7&#x02013;10 days in human fibroblasts. Both treatments reduced ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>) and &#x003b3;H2A.X foci frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>) equally, even if started weeks after induction of senescence, indicating that the feedback loop remains active in deep senescence. Treatments also enhanced MMP over the whole time frame (data not shown). Treatments that were begun within 1 week after induction of DDR effectively rescued growth arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C&#x02013;F</xref>). After 20 Gy IR, all fibroblasts were stably negative for the proliferation-associated antigen Ki67, but this was rescued in up to 30&#x00025; of the cells by treatment with either SB203580 or PBN, if the treatment was started within up to 9 days after induction of SIPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). Almost all of the Ki67-positive cells were negative for expression of CDKN1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that these cells were not merely re-entering G1 but had the potential to progress into the cell cycle. In fact, we observed robust recovery of proliferation in cells treated with SB203580 or PBN at 6 days after SIPS induction in both bulk culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>) and clonal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4F</xref>) assays. Treated cells grew at normal proliferation rates for at least several weeks whereas there was no growth at all in untreated cells after 20 Gy IR, indicating that the treatments not simply postponed but actually rescued senescence. Very similar results were obtained if cells irradiated with a lower dose of 5 Gy were treated either at 2 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S15</xref>) or at 6 days after irradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S16</xref>). Moreover, post treatment of 5 Gy-irradiated cells with another antioxidant, <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine, rescued cell proliferation (data not shown).</p><p>We compared the experimentally observed rescue of growth with the predictions from the stochastic model. After single cell traces in the model, we observed that under SB203580 treatment some cells would for some time display CDKN1A values below the basal mean CDKN1A protein level as established in proliferating cells before IR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S17</xref>). We set a threshold level for CDKN1A in our stochastic model at 2 &#x000d7; standard deviation above basal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>) and assumed that cells would recover from growth arrest if CDKN1A levels would remain continuously below this threshold for at least 6 h (i.e. allowing for passage through the CDKN1A-dependent G1/S border). Querying 500 individual cell tracks we found 96 cells (19.2&#x00025;) under SB203580 treatment fulfilling this criterion, whereas none did so after IR alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S16</xref>). A comparison with the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C&#x02013;F</xref>) shows that this model quantitatively predicts rescue of growth arrest by feedback loop inhibition.</p><p>Together, these results indicate that the feedback loop between DDR and ROS production is necessary and sufficient to maintain cell cycle arrest for at least 1 week after initiation of SIPS. However, at time points later than 9 days after initiation of senescence, the inhibition of feedback signalling became progressively less efficient in rescuing the arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that additional mechanisms not accounted for in our model stabilize growth arrest in deep senescence. Stabilization of the growth arrest in deep senescence might be due partly to gross changes in chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Narita et al, 2003</xref>). Levels of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) and HP-1&#x003b3; foci, two markers for senescence-associated chromatin re-modelling, were low at 6 days after IR but increased over the following weeks in parallel with the irreversibility of growth arrest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S18</xref>). Treatments of cells with either SB203580 or PBN at a late time point (10 days after IR), which did not effectively rescue growth, also did not change SAHF-associated nuclear granularity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S18C</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DNA damage signalling through CDKN1A results in increased ROS-mediated damage <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To assess the relevance of feedback loop signalling for generation of oxidative damage <italic>in vivo</italic> we used primary embryonic fibroblasts (mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MEFs) and tissues from late generation (G4) <italic>TERC</italic>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212; and <italic>G4TERC&#x02212;/&#x02212;CDKN1A&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice.

Interestingly, the co-localization of telomeres and the remaining foci was closest in the double-KO MEFs, confirming that loss of signalling through CDKN1A preferentially reduced non-telomeric foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>).

More recently, it was shown that oncogene-induced senescence can lead to AMPK activation, mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production, which in turn can trigger senescence on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Moiseeva et al, 2009</xref>), so suggesting yet another feedback loop involving ROS in senescence. The retinoblastoma protein pRb is an important downstream mediator of growth arrest for both the CDKN1A and CDKN2A pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Chang et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Dai and Enders, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Beausejour et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Takahashi et al, 2006</xref>). However, in our system of primary human or mouse fibroblasts neither CDKN2A nor pRb was necessarily involved in the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production.</p><p>Although we do not rule out the existence of other pathways stabilizing ROS production in senescent cells, we have identified signalling through CDKN1A, MAPK14 and TGF&#x003b2; as the important link between telomere-dependent and -independent DDR and ROS production in primary human and mice fibroblasts. This identification has been informed by <italic>in silico</italic> interactome analysis and quantitative stochastic modelling. Interactome analysis allows the integration of large amounts of data from a wide range of sources, even if they are available only in a dispersed set of databases, as is often the case with results of high-throughput experiments. Possible relationships between genes that do not directly interact can be analysed by standard graph-theoretic algorithms, such as the shortest-paths analysis used here. The assignment of LLS to edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Lee et al, 2004</xref>) provided a measure of strength to individual interactions, and permitted ranking of possible paths in order of biological plausibility. Major limitations of interactomes are their limited directionality and their static nature. As first steps to overcome these limitations, we combined Biogrid data with Phospho.ELM, a genome-wide protein phosphorylation database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Diella et al, 2008</xref>) and overlaid the results with a query-specific set of gene expression data.</p><p>A hallmark of aging processes, including cellular senescence, is their inherent stochastic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Kirkwood et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Passos et al, 2007a</xref>). Therefore, we chose a quantitative model that can account for random processes and explain stochastic variation. This also enabled us to deal appropriately with molecular species present only at very low copy number (e.g. DNA damage foci) and with fractions of cells developing distinct outcomes (e.g. re-enter proliferation after intervention).</p><p>Importantly, we found that ROS levels increase in senescent cells as a result of signalling through CDKN1A-GADD45A-MAPK14-GRB2-TGF&#x003b2; and feed back into DNA damage induction and response, generating a stable, self-sustaining feedback loop. This feedback loop persists even in irreversible deep senescence <italic>in vitro</italic> and in senescent cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. During the establishment phase of senescence, the loop is necessary and sufficient for maintenance of replication arrest. Thus, it is a necessary prerequisite for establishment of irreversible senescence.</p><p>Our data strongly suggest that during the early establishment phase of senescence a minimum frequency of DNA damage foci is necessary to maintain growth arrest long enough to allow cells to proceed towards irreversibility. This threshold frequency appears to be around five foci per nucleus in our experiments, but might be different in different cells and/or under different experimental conditions. Importantly, our data show that these foci do not have to be permanent themselves to induce permanent growth arrest. Cells might encounter permanent damage (i.e. uncapped telomeres) or high levels of, in principle, repairable damage (e.g. after high doses of IR). In any case, if this situation cannot be resolved within 1&#x02013;2 days, a cell-autonomous program is activated, which permanently generates ROS and ROS-mediated DNA damage. The ensuing stochastic equilibrium of damage induction and repair maintains DNA damage signalling above threshold until further mechanisms (including but not necessarily limited to CDKN2A activation, autocrine signalling and chromatin remodelling) ensure permanent cell cycle arrest. Finding that about half of all foci in senescent cells are short lived, and that short-lived foci are necessary and sufficient to maintain stability of growth arrest in our model of SIPS does not imply that persistent, irreparable DNA damage signalling might not be sufficient to induce senescence under some conditions. However, it shows that the assumption that DNA damage needs to be irreparable and persistent to generate a persistent proliferation arrest is not necessary. Rather, transient DNA damage can have an important role for senescence, as long as it is constantly replenished by a positive feedback loop that maintains a dynamic equilibrium between damage induction and repair.</p><p>An added layer of complexity is that foci composition can change with time. For instance, 53BP1, MRE11 and NBS1 are lost from DNA damage foci as cells enter mitosis, whereas &#x003b3;H2AX and MDC1 remain focally concentrated with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Nelson et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Nakamura et al, 2010</xref>). Compositional changes of foci might also occur in tissues during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Panda et al, 2008</xref>). A better apprehension of foci dynamics will aid understanding of cellular damage responses and aging.</p><p>Oxygen levels in standard cell culture are unphysiologically high, and that causes increased ROS production at least partially from the mitochondria leading to acceleration of telomere-dependent senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">von Zglinicki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Passos et al, 2007a</xref>) and/or SIPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Parrinello et al, 2003</xref>). This does not imply that the induction of an ROS-generating feedback loop in senescence as described here is a cell culture artefact; however, ROS levels and DDR are still regulated in the same p21-dependent manner in MEFs under physiologically low ambient oxygen concentration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, DDR and oxidative stress are closely associated during telomere-independent cell senescence in aging mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">Wang et al, 2009</xref>), and this association is dependent on p21 (this study). Telomere-dependent senescence can be postponed by lowering mitochondrial ROS production and/or release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Saretzki et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Passos et al, 2007a</xref>), which might be due to both slower telomere shortening and decreased levels of non-telomeric DDR. Finally, recent data indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production is triggered through p53- and pRb-dependent pathways in oncogenic ras-induced senescence and is able to contribute to ras-dependent growth arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Moiseeva et al, 2009</xref>). Together, these data suggest that a feedback loop involving mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production might well be important in various physiologically relevant forms of cell senescence.</p><p>We speculate that mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production might be causal for the development of the senescent phenotype. Mitochondrial dysfunction including ROS production induces retrograde response, a major re-programming of nuclear gene expression patterns, in senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Butow and Avadhani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Passos et al, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">2007c</xref>). Recent work implicated not only ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bartek et al, 2007</xref>) but also factors involved in growth factor, chemokine and cytokine signalling as essential for oncogene-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Acosta et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kuilman et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Wajapeyee et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Kuilman and Peeper, 2009</xref>). Many gene products from these families take part in retrograde response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Butow and Avadhani, 2004</xref>), and they interact with TP53 and MAPK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Acosta et al, 2008</xref>). A detailed examination of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction for the establishment of the secretory senescent phenotype is clearly warranted.</p><p>Although senescent cells can be cleared away efficiently from tissues under some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">Ventura et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Krizhanovsky et al, 2008</xref>), cells bearing various senescence markers including DNA damage foci do accumulate in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Dimri et al, 1995</xref>), primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Herbig et al, 2006</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">Wang et al, 2009</xref>) tissues with advancing age. The fact that DNA damage foci are associated with ROS production <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (this paper) suggests that tissue-resident cells with an activated DDR may disturb tissue function and homeostasis not only by secreting biologically active peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Coppe et al, 2008</xref>) but also by inducing ROS-mediated damage in their microenvironment. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is the main product of mitochondrial, cytoplasmic and extracellular superoxide dismutation. It is soluble in both water and lipid and is a relatively long-lived ROS, allowing for easy diffusion between cells. Thus, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> release from cells with activated DDR might contribute to the &#x02018;bystander effect', whereby senescent cells appear to &#x02018;infect' their originally unstressed neighbours(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Sokolov et al, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our results show that interventions against individual components of the senescent phenotype (e.g. ROS production) are possible in deep senescence. Even if these interventions do not rescue the growth arrest phenotype, they can ameliorate the phenotypic impact of senescent cells onto their microenvironment (the &#x02018;bystander effect'). There is a preliminary evidence that &#x02018;anti-senescence' interventions have potential to delay aging. However, interventions upstream of the cell cycle checkpoint machinery may significantly increase cancer risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baker et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Tomas-Loba et al, 2008</xref>). Improved understanding of the networks of signalling pathways that govern the senescent phenotype will undoubtedly help to identify the most promising targets to ameliorate the negative impact of aged cells on their environment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cells and tissues</title><p>T19 cells containing a doxycycline inducible TRF2<sup>&#x00394;B&#x00394;M</sup> and the retroviral expression vector pLPCNMyc-TRF2 <sup>&#x00394;B&#x00394;M</sup> were gifts from T de Lange, Rockefeller University, NY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">van Steensel et al, 1998</xref>).
