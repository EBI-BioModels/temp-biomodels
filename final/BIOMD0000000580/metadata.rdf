  <div class="dc:title">Sonntag2012 - mTOR model - IRS dependent regulation of AMPK by insulin</div>
  <div class="dc:description">TSC1-TSC2 complex has two states: 1)
active (TSC1_TSC2_pS1387), regulated by AMPK_pT172; 2) inactive
(TSC1_TSC2_pT1462) regulated by Akt_pT308. Particularly, mTORC1 is
inhibited by TSC1_TSC2 in active state. AMPK is activated at T172
by the species IRS1_p activated by the insulin receptor upon
insulin stimulation. Consequently, AMPK_pT172 is inhibited by
mTORC1_pS2448 indirectly by the p70-S6K-negative feedback loop.

    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase responds to
    growth factors, nutrients and cellular energy status and is a
    central controller of cellular growth. mTOR exists in two
    multiprotein complexes that are embedded into a complex
    signalling network. Adenosine monophosphate-dependent kinase
    (AMPK) is activated by energy deprivation and shuts off
    adenosine 5&apos;-triphosphate (ATP)-consuming anabolic processes,
    in part via the inactivation of mTORC1. Surprisingly, we
    observed that AMPK not only responds to energy deprivation but
    can also be activated by insulin, and is further induced in
    mTORC1-deficient cells. We have recently modelled the mTOR
    network, covering both mTOR complexes and their insulin and
    nutrient inputs. In the present study we extended the network
    by an AMPK module to generate the to date most comprehensive
    data-driven dynamic AMPK-mTOR network model. In order to define
    the intersection via which AMPK is activated by the insulin
    network, we compared simulations for six different hypothetical
    model structures to our observed AMPK dynamics. Hypotheses
    ranking suggested that the most probable intersection between
    insulin and AMPK was the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and
    that the effects of canonical IRS downstream cues on AMPK would
    be mediated via an mTORC1-driven negative-feedback loop. We
    tested these predictions experimentally in multiple set-ups,
    where we inhibited or induced players along the insulin-mTORC1
    signalling axis and observed AMPK induction or inhibition. We
    confirmed the identified model and therefore report a novel
    connection within the insulin-mTOR-AMPK network: we conclude
    that AMPK is positively regulated by IRS and can be inhibited
    via the negative-feedback loop.</p>
