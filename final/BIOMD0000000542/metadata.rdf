    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The multifactorial nature of disease motivates the use of
    systems-level analyses to understand their pathology. We used a
    systems biology approach to study tau aggregation, one of the
    hallmark features of Alzheimer&apos;s disease. A mathematical model
    was constructed to capture the current state of knowledge
    concerning tau&apos;s behavior and interactions in cells. The model
    was implemented in silico in the form of ordinary differential
    equations. The identifiability of the model was assessed and
    parameters were estimated to generate two cellular states: a
    population of solutions that corresponds to normal tau
    homeostasis and a population of solutions that displays
    aggregation-prone behavior. The model of normal tau homeostasis
    was robust to perturbations, and disturbances in multiple
    processes were required to achieve an aggregation-prone state.
    The aggregation-prone state was ultrasensitive to perturbations
    in diverse subsets of networks. Tau aggregation requires that
    multiple cellular parameters are set coordinately to a set of
    values that drive pathological assembly of tau. This model
    provides a foundation on which to build and increase our
    understanding of the series of events that lead to tau
    aggregation and may ultimately be used to identify critical
    intervention points that can direct the cell away from tau
    aggregation to aid in the treatment of tau-mediated (or
    related) aggregation diseases including Alzheimer&apos;s.</p>
