Abstract:<br/>
Myosin-V is a motor protein responsible for organelle and vesicle transport in cells. Recent single-molecule experiments have shown that it is an efficient processive motor that walks along actin filaments taking steps of mean size close to 36 nm. A theoretical study of myosin-V motility is presented following an approach used successfully to analyze the dynamics of conventional kinesin but also taking some account of step-size variations. Much of the present experimental data for myosin-V can be well described by a two-state chemical kinetic model with three load-dependent rates. In addition, the analysis predicts the variation of the mean velocity and of the randomness-a quantitative measure of the stochastic deviations from uniform, constant-speed motion-with ATP concentration under both resisting and assisting loads, and indicates a substep of size d(0) approximately 13-14 nm (from the ATP-binding state) that appears to accord with independent observations.
</p>
  <p>The model differs slightly from the published version. The ATP and ADP bound forms of myosin are called S0 and S1. The state transition and binding constants are called k_1, k_2, k_3 and k_4 instead of k<sup>0</sup>
  <sub>0</sub>, u<sup>0</sup>
  <sub>1</sub>, k<sup>&apos;</sup>
  <sub>0</sub> and  w<sup>0</sup>
  <sub>1</sub>. Similarly the state loading factors are named th_1, th_2,  th_3 and th_4 instead of  θ<sup>+</sup>
  <sub>0</sub>, θ<sup>+</sup>
  <sub>1</sub>, θ<sup>-</sup>
  <sub>0</sub> and  θ<sup>-</sup>
  <sub>1</sub>. The species fwd_step1, fwd_step2, back_step1 and back_step2 count the number of state changes of each kind the myosine molecules have taken over time.<br/>
The model can be evaluated in a deterministic continuous or stochastic discreet fashion. The parameter V holds the (forward) speed at each time point, the V_avg the overall way divided by the simulation time and the amount of myosine molecules.
