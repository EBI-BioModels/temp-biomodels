    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Curcumin is a natural compound obtained from turmeric, and
    is well known for its pharmacological effects. In this work, we
    design a heterologous pathway for industrial production of
    curcumin in Escherichia coli. A kinetic model of the pathway is
    then developed and connected to a kinetic model of the central
    carbon metabolism of E. coli. This model is used for
    optimization of the mutant strain through a rational design
    approach, and two manipulation targets are identified for
    overexpression. Dynamic simulations are then performed to
    compare the curcumin production profiles of the different
    mutant strains. Our results show that it is possible to obtain
    a significant improvement in the curcumin production rates with
    the proposed mutants. The kinetic model here developed can be
    an important framework to optimize curcumin production at an
    industrial scale and add value to its biomedical potential.</p>
