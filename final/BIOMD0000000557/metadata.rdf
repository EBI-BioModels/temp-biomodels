    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Serine/threonine/tyrosine-interacting protein (STYX) is a
    catalytically inactive member of the dual-specificity
    phosphatases (DUSPs) family. Whereas the role of DUSPs in
    cellular signaling is well explored, the function of STYX is
    still unknown. Here, we identify STYX as a spatial regulator of
    ERK signaling. We used predictive-model simulation to test
    several hypotheses for possible modes of STYX action. We show
    that STYX localizes to the nucleus, competes with nuclear DUSP4
    for binding to ERK, and acts as a nuclear anchor that regulates
    ERK nuclear export. Depletion of STYX increases ERK activity in
    both cytosol and nucleus. Importantly, depletion of STYX causes
    an ERK-dependent fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus and
    inhibits Golgi polarization and directional cell migration.
    Finally, we show that overexpression of STYX reduces ERK1/2
    activation, thereby blocking PC12 cell differentiation.
    Overall, our results identify STYX as an important regulator of
    ERK1/2 signaling critical for cell migration and PC12 cell
    differentiation.</p>
