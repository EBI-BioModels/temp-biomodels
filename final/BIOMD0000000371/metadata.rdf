  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
Secretion of insulin by electrically coupled populations of pancreatic beta
-cells is governed by bursting electrical activity. Isolated beta -cells,
however, exhibit atypical bursting or continuous spike activity. We study
bursting as an emergent property of the population, focussing on interactions
among the subclass of spiking cells. These are modelled by equipping the fast
subsystem with a saddle-node-loop bifurcation, which makes it monostable. Such
cells can only spike tonically or remain silent when isolated, but can be
induced to burst with weak diffusive coupling. With stronger coupling, the cells
revert to tonic spiking. We demonstrate that the addition of noise dramatically
increases, via a phenomenon like stochastic resonance, the coupling range over
which bursting is seen. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.
