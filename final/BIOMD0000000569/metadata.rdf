    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Modulation of the properties of AMPA receptors at the
    post-synaptic membrane is one of the main suggested mechanisms
    underlying fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous
    system of vertebrates. Electrophysiological recordings of
    single channels stimulated with agonists showed that both
    recombinant and native AMPA receptors visit multiple
    conductance states in an agonist concentration dependent
    manner. We propose an allosteric model of the multiple
    conductance states based on concerted conformational
    transitions of the four subunits, as an iris diaphragm. Our
    model predicts that the thermodynamic behaviour of the
    conductance states upon full and partial agonist stimulations
    can be described with increased affinity of receptors as they
    progress to higher conductance states. The model also predicts
    the existence of AMPA receptors in non-liganded conductive
    substates. However, the probability of spontaneous openings
    decreases with increasing conductances. Finally, we predict
    that the large conductance states are stabilized within the
    rise phase of a whole-cell EPSC in glutamatergic hippocampal
    neurons. Our model provides a mechanistic link between ligand
    concentration and conductance states that can explain
    thermodynamic and kinetic features of AMPA receptor gating.</p>
