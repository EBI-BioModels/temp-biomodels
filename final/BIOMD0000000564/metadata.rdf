    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Circadian clocks exhibit &apos;temperature compensation&apos;, meaning
    that they show only small changes in period over a broad
    temperature range. Several clock genes have been implicated in
    the temperature-dependent control of period in Arabidopsis. We
    show that blue light is essential for this, suggesting that the
    effects of light and temperature interact or converge upon
    common targets in the circadian clock. Our data demonstrate
    that two cryptochrome photoreceptors differentially control
    circadian period and sustain rhythmicity across the
    physiological temperature range. In order to test the
    hypothesis that the targets of light regulation are sufficient
    to mediate temperature compensation, we constructed a
    temperature-compensated clock model by adding passive
    temperature effects into only the light-sensitive processes in
    the model. Remarkably, this model was not only capable of full
    temperature compensation and consistent with mRNA profiles
    across a temperature range, but also predicted the
    temperature-dependent change in the level of LATE ELONGATED
    HYPOCOTYL, a key clock protein. Our analysis provides a
    systems-level understanding of period control in the plant
    circadian oscillator.</p>
