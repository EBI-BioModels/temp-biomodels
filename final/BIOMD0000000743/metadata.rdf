Abstract: 
In this work, we analyze a mathematical model we introduced previously for the dynamics of multiple myeloma and the immune system. We focus on four main aspects: (1) obtaining and justifying ranges and values for all parameters in the model; (2) determining a subset of parameters to which the model is most sensitive; (3) determining which parameters in this subset can be uniquely estimated given cer- tain types of data; and (4) exploring the model numerically. Using global sensitivity analysis techniques, we found that the model is most sensitive to certain growth, loss, and efficacy parameters. This anal- ysis provides the foundation for a future application of the model: prediction of optimal combination regimens in patients with multiple myeloma.
