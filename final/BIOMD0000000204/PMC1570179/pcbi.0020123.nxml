In addition to regulating each other through feedback loops, these genes also regulate downstream target genes involved in the maintenance and differentiation of embryonic stem cells. A search for the OCT4&#x02013;SOX2&#x02013;NANOG network motif in other species reveals that it is unique to mammals. With a kinetic modeling approach, we ascribe function to the observed OCT4&#x02013;SOX2&#x02013;NANOG network by making plausible assumptions about the interactions between the transcription factors at the gene promoter binding sites and RNA polymerase (RNAP), at each of the three genes as well as at the target genes. We identify a bistable switch in the network, which arises due to several positive feedback loops, and is switched <sc>on/off</sc> by input environmental signals. The switch stabilizes the expression levels of the three genes, and through their regulatory roles on the downstream target genes, leads to a binary decision: when OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are expressed and the switch is <sc>on</sc>, the self-renewal genes are <sc>on</sc> and the differentiation genes are <sc>off</sc>. The opposite holds when the switch is <sc>off</sc>. The model is extremely robust to parameter changes. In addition to providing a self-consistent picture of the transcriptional circuit, the model generates several predictions. Increasing the binding strength of NANOG to OCT4 and SOX2, or increasing its basal transcriptional rate, leads to an irreversible bistable switch: the switch remains <sc>on</sc> even when the activating signal is removed. Hence, the stem cell can be manipulated to be self-renewing without the requirement of input signals. We also suggest tests that could discriminate between a variety of feedforward regulation architectures of the target genes by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>One key issue in developmental biology is how embryonic stem cells are regulated at the genetic level. Recent high throughput experiments have elucidated the architecture of the gene regulatory network responsible for embryonic stem cell fate decisions in human and mouse. In this work the authors develop a computational model to describe the mutual regulation of the genes involved in these networks and their subsequent effects on downstream target genes. They find that the core genetic network incorporates the functionality of a bistable switch, which arises due to positive feedback loops in the system. Also, this switch behaviour is very robust with respect to model parameters. The switch and architecture by which the genetic network regulates the downstream genes, is responsible for either maintaining the genes responsible for self-renewal <sc>on</sc>, and genes involved with differentiation <sc>off</sc>, or the opposite outcome, depending on whether the switch is <sc>on/off</sc>, respectively. The model also provides several predictions which can lead to further understanding of the network. The methods employed are fairly standard and transparent which facilitates further uncovering in future experimental investigations of genetic networks.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Chickarmane V, Troein C, Nuber UA, Sauro HM, Peterson C (2006) Transcriptional dynamics of the embryonic stem cell switch.

Understanding the factors that determine the ability of ES cells to maintain their self-renewal and pluripotency, and the interplay of these factors, is of utmost relevance for both developmental biology and stem cell research. Over the last two years, a trio of transcription factors (TFs) have emerged&#x02014;OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG&#x02014;which play a key role in determining the fate of ES cells [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Many of these findings appear to hold both for human and murine systems, but some distinct differences exist with regard to target genes (TGs) of these transcriptional regulators and external factors. For example, LIF and BMP4 are critical external factors which maintain mouse, but not human, ES cells in vitro [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast, BMP4 induces trophoblast differentiation of human ES cells [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and this is accompanied by downregulation of OCT4. Factors involved in maintaining and propagating human ES cells are bFGF, Activin A, and the BMP antagonist Noggin [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The wnt pathway is important for both murine and human ES cell maintenance [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We consider networks that apply to both mouse and human. For reasons of simplicity, we use the symbols SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG for both species.</p><p>Recently, two genome-wide studies [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] were performed, in which these TFs were localized at promoter regions of human and mouse ES cells. Several transcriptional bindings were discovered: NANOG binds to the promoter regions of OCT4 and SOX2, as well as to its own. In addition, the OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 heterodimer regulates NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 individually. What emerges is a compact network with self-regulation and positive feedback. As pointed out in [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and revealed by another large gene perturbation study with mouse ES cells [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG also regulate a number of other genes. Many of these TGs are themselves TFs, some are responsible for maintaining ES cells by controlling self-renewal and pluripotency, and others perform key developmental functions that include differentiation into extra-embryonic, endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal cell types [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Such genes, which are crucial for development, are found to be repressed in ES cells. Henceforth, when we refer to <italic>differentiation genes,</italic> we imply a set of genes that are upregulated upon differentiation of ES cells and are negatively regulated by NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2. Similarly, by <italic>stem cell genes</italic> we mean those genes that are expressed in ES cells and are positively regulated by the three TFs. Thus, in this study we concentrate on TGs regulated by all three factors.</p><p>The three TFs OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG thus regulate genes with two distinct and opposing functions: self-renewal and differentiation. The TGs are regulated both by OCT4 and NANOG individually, and by the combined effects of OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 and NANOG [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, since OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 activates NANOG, the TGs are at the receiving end of a feedforward loop [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We explore the consequences of this architectural feature after establishing the dynamics of the core of the network.</p><p>The core transcriptional network that emerges from [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>. We have investigated whether similar architectures exist in the gene regulatory networks of other organisms. Our study suggests that the architecture is unique to higher organisms, and it cannot be found outside the ES cell system from the available databases.

Several growth factors triggering certain signal transduction pathways required for keeping ES cells in an undifferentiated and multipotent state as well supporting their self-renewal have been described in the literature as mentioned above. These factors can be different for human and mouse ES cells. However, a signal pathway positively controlling both mouse and human ES cells is, for example, the wnt pathway (<italic>A</italic>

Using these tools we can describe the regulation of downstream TGs by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG and explore the switch between self-renewal/pluripotency and differentiation&#x02014;two very different outcomes.</p><p>The transcriptional network of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref> contains positive feedback loops, which will turn out to give rise to bistable switch-like behavior, for a wide range of dynamical model parameters. Through the feedback loops, the expression of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG can be jointly triggered or blocked by the environmental signals. We will argue that this switch-like behavior is highly useful in the context of stem cells, as it gives a clear separation of two very different cell fates: either maintain a stem cell state and differentiation is blocked or self-renewal and pluripotency of the ES cell is lost and differentiation is initiated. In Boolean terms, the stem cell genes should be <sc>on</sc> and the differentiation genes <sc>off</sc>, or the other way around, depending on whether the trio of TFs all are <sc>on</sc> or <sc>off</sc>. The model explains, qualitatively, several experimentally observed results concerning the behavior of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG and their downstream TGs for maintaining an ES cell and for differentiation with respect to upstream signals. We use the model to generate several predictions. These predictions could be used to further validate the model or to pinpoint missing components.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Our system naturally divides into two parts: 1) The &#x0201c;stem cell box&#x0201d; with the tightly interacting OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG genes; and 2) their downstream targets&#x02014;the stem cell and differentiation genes. After modeling each of these subsystems individually, the integrated model is described.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>The Stem Cell Box</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Architecture.</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref> we consider the basic transcriptional circuit as described in [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We identify a central core, or stem cell box, consisting of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. OCT4 and SOX2 form a heterodimer, OCT4&#x02013;SOX2, which positively regulates OCT4 and SOX2 [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and NANOG [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. NANOG, in turn, regulates both OCT4 and SOX2, and from perturbation studies this regulation appears to be of an activating nature [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. NANOG also regulates itself and from [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] this autoregulation can be inferred to be positive. In summary, what emerges is a network with many positive feedback loops. In [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the authors report two interaction motifs encountered in the mutual regulation of OCT4 and SOX2. One motif is autoregulation, where OCT4 and SOX2 regulate themselves. The other motif discussed is mutual activation, where OCT4 and SOX2 activate each other. This motif can sometimes establish switch-like behavior, where either both genes are <sc>on</sc> or both are <sc>off</sc>. In the case of the OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 submodule in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>, both these motifs stem from the formation of a heterodimer, OCT4&#x02013;SOX2, which binds to the promoter regions of both SOX2 and OCT4. Furthermore, NANOG, which is activated by OCT4 and SOX2 through the action of the heterodimer, directly regulates OCT4 and SOX2 as an activator, thereby providing further positive feedback.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Phylogeny of architecture.</title><p>Prior to exploring the dynamics of the stem cell box, we examine whether its architecture occurs in the gene regulatory networks of other species. Such a search may lead to a better understanding of the network, if one could compare its functionality across different organisms.

The network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref> can be reduced to varying degrees to yield the stylized interaction networks shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g002">Figure 2</xref>.

It seems likely that for cell-fate decision systems, especially in stem cells where distinct possibilities are faced by the cell, an external signal concentration can switch a system to its final state [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Bistability naturally leads to hysteresis, the retention of memory, whereby the cell can maintain its state even on removal of the external signal. Recent work [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] has experimentally demonstrated hysteresis in mammalian gene networks. In signaling and genetic networks, bistability arises from the nonlinearity and positive feedback loops of the protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;gene interactions [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Switch-like behavior is seen in most systems that have autoregulation, positive feedback, and mutually antagonistic interactions, as has been demonstrated in several synthetic circuits [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. With regard to stem cells, several examples where autoregulatory TFs are involved in cell fate are discussed in [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In theoretical models that describe regulation of stem cells, autoregulatory and mutually antagonistic interactions have been argued to lead to switch-like behavior [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>We have examined the robustness of switch-like behavior of the stem cell box to changes in parameter values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020123-sd001">Protocol S1</xref> for details). The system exhibits bistability for a wide range of parameter values, such as TF binding efficiencies, degradation rates, and basal transcription rates. In particular, due to the positive feedback loops between OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, the model predicts that increasing the binding efficiency of NANOG to OCT4 and SOX2 leads to stronger positive feedback, and then less activation from <italic>A</italic>

In what follows we confine ourselves to the latter alternative. Experimentally it is known that when the three TFs are expressed, the stem cell TGs are <sc>on</sc> and the differentiation TGs are <sc>off</sc>, and vice versa. In what follows we will focus on TGs that are regulated by the joint actions of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>. From a dynamical standpoint, these TGs are more interesting than those regulated by only one of the three TFs.</p><p>The OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 heterodimer regulates NANOG, and together OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 and NANOG then regulate the TGs. This is a realization of the feedforward loop motif [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Feedforward loops can lead to two types of dynamics depending upon the interaction between the two signals that control the TG. In the coherent case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), the feedforward loop can act as a low pass filter, only responding to persistent signals [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, in the incoherent case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), the TG activity can react strongly to transients, since the suppressing signal is delayed by passing through NANOG from OCT4&#x02013;SOX2. This has been suggested to be a general mechanism for improving response times in transcriptional networks [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Recently, it has also been argued that such incoherent feedforward loops could be very important in establishing spatial stripes and pulsed temporal expression profiles of TFs involved in developmental processes [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0020123-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Coherent and Incoherent Feedforward Network Motifs</title><p>(A) Coherent.</p><p>(B) Incoherent.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.0020123.g005"/></fig><p>Whether the feedforward mechanisms governing the stem cell and differentiation genes are coherent or incoherent is not known.

The second case will be commented upon in the next section.</p><p>To focus on the dynamics of the feedforward regulation of TGs, we will here assume a fixed OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 concentration, i.e., exclude the effects of the feedback of NANOG to OCT4 and SOX2. In the next section we integrate the stem cell box of the previous section with the feedforward regulation.</p><p>We assume the following regulatory mechanism at the TGs: OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 binds to the TGs as an activator and recruits NANOG. Together the OCT4&#x02013;SOX2, NANOG complex then acts as a repressor for the TGs. For low OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 concentrations, the TGs are activated. As the level is increased, the NANOG concentration grows, thereby enabling OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 and NANOG to repress the TGs. The steady state response of this circuit is therefore maximal at an intermediate OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 concentration, giving rise to a behavior of an &#x0201c;amplitude filter&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The circuit functions as a &#x0201c;concentration detector,&#x0201d; providing maximal output for inputs within a certain range [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>With constant input concentration [<italic>OS</italic>] to the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), we obtain for the TG transcription rates:

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g006">Figure 6</xref> we plot state values of NANOG concentration and the TG expression as functions of the OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 concentration ([<italic>OS</italic>]). We also compare with these curves, the steady state values computed for a simple feedforward, i.e., NANOG does not have any autoregulation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, as [<italic>OS</italic>] increases, NANOG is activated, and since it is autoregulatory, at some threshold of [<italic>OS</italic>], NANOG is fully turned on. NANOG then binds cooperatively with OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 at the TGs, causing repression of those genes. This can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, where we plot differentiation gene expression. We observe a phase of linear growth with [<italic>OS</italic>], when the TGs are activated and the level of NANOG is low, followed by a rapid decline when NANOG becomes highly activated. As expected, this system behaves like an amplitude filter, whereby the response of the differentiation TGs peaks at a certain input of [<italic>OS</italic>]. It is interesting to compare this response with the case where NANOG lacks autoregulation, i.e., a simple feedforward network (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020123-sd001">Protocol S1</xref> for parameter values). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g006">Figure 6</xref>A for this case shows that NANOG levels are fairly low, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g006">Figure 6</xref>B the differentiation TG expression, although showing a peaked behavior, is significantly wider compared with the case where NANOG is autoregulatory. Hence, with a simple feedforward network, it is not possible to adequately suppress the differentiation TGs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, we compare the steady state behavior of the stem cell gene expression with that of the differentiation genes, when the binding of NANOG to OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 is weaker at the stem cell genes than at the differentiation genes. As can be seen, the expression of the differentiation TGs vanishes at the same time as expression of the stem cell TGs saturates, even though the regulatory mechanisms are qualitatively the same. The role of NANOG autoregulation in the incoherent feedforward loop is to provide a sharper cutoff, leading to a narrower amplitude bandwidth, for the differentiation gene expression as a function of [<italic>OS</italic>].

The switch-like behavior is now recovered, which ensures a more rapid falloff of the TGs. Weak feedback from NANOG to OCT4 and SOX2 can be counterbalanced by increasing the autoregulatory feedback of NANOG, since increased NANOG levels are then available for binding to OCT4 and SOX2 thereby restoring the positive feedback loop. We have confirmed this behaviour with simulations (unpublished data). Hence, feedback of NANOG to OCT4 and SOX2 is complementary to NANOG autoregulation, and in a sense they are both &#x0201c;fallback&#x0201d; options to recovering the switch-like behavior.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020123-g009" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Steady State Values of TG Expression as a Function of the Input Concentration <italic>A</italic>

Our data analysis has shown that the transcriptional subnetwork between OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG has no counterparts in available information from non-mammalian genomes. Hence, one cannot rely on phylogenetics to confirm and deduce the function of the architecture. Instead, dynamical modeling of the system is called for [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. To this end, a continuous differential equation model based upon the Shea&#x02013;Ackers formalism [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was employed, and using this we have developed a model for the core transcriptional dynamics of ES cells involving the OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG genes, their self-regulation, as well as their regulation of stem cell and differentiation TGs.</p><p>We have identified a bistable switch in the network consisting of the OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG genes, which arises due to positive feedback loops: OCT4 and SOX2 regulate each other through the formation of a heterodimer. This heterodimer regulates NANOG, which feeds back to OCT4 and SOX2. NANOG also binds to its own promoter region as an activator, and this autoregulation acts to further strengthen the positive feedback loop. The two states of the stem cell box switch, where the trio of TFs are all <sc>on</sc> or <sc>off</sc>, correspond to stem cell and differentiation, respectively. The switch was found to be robust with respect to model parameters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020123-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>), a property arising from the architecture. The stem cell box can be switched <sc>on</sc> by a signal <italic>A</italic>
<sub>+</sub>, where examples may include wnt for mouse and human ES cells and LIF for mouse ES cells. Suppression of NANOG by the signal <italic>B</italic>
<sub>&#x02212;</sub>, exemplified by p53 in mouse, turns the switch <sc>off</sc>. We speculate that it is perhaps more practical to use <italic>B</italic>
<sub>&#x02212;</sub> to turn the switch <sc>off</sc>, than to remove the signal <italic>A</italic>
<sub>+</sub>, since external growth factors positively regulating the three TFs might still be present in the environment of an ES cell when it starts to differentiate. One way this can be achieved is that DNA damage in mouse induces p53, which can downregulate NANOG, and ultimately induce differentiation. Recent experiments [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] show that the transcriptional stem cell network for mouse is similar to that for human ES cells [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is interesting to speculate whether p53 has the same effect in human ES cells, i<italic>.</italic>e<italic>.</italic>, repressing NANOG and shutting <sc>off</sc> the stem cell box, thereby leading to differentiation. Since our model applies to both mouse and human ES cells, several of the generic predictions that the model offers can be tested in either organism.</p><p>Next we considered the regulation of TGs by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, pointing out that if the TGs are regulated individually by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, then the stem cell box dynamics takes care of keeping the stem cell genes <sc>on</sc> and the differentiation genes <sc>off</sc>. We therefore focused on those TGs that are jointly regulated by the OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 heterodimer and NANOG.</p><p>Two options for the regulation of TGs were modeled, and we found that both were consistent with the requirement that stem cell genes are <sc>on</sc> and differentiation genes are <sc>off</sc> when the stem cell box is <sc>on</sc>. Below we suggest possible tests to discriminate between the two options. We also argue that an incoherent feedforward loop with autoregulation gives rise to an &#x0201c;amplitude filter&#x0201d; effect, which provides the required repressive behavior of differentiation TGs when the switch is <sc>on</sc>, and a stable expression level for the stem cell TGs if the binding of NANOG to the TG is weak. Both sets of genes can thus be regulated with the same architecture. In this case the autoregulation plays two roles: it enhances the positive feedback loop for the stem cell box; it also decreases the bandwidth of the amplitude filter thereby providing a sharper cutoff.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Predictions</title><p>We now discuss several predictions that emerge from this model.</p><p>1) We have explored the parameter space of the model (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020123-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>) and found that if the binding efficiency of OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 and NANOG to both OCT4 and SOX2 is increased, one obtains an irreversible bistable switch.

This results in decreasing/increasing expression of the stem cell TGs for options I and II, respectively.</p><p>4) Analogous to the above case, decreasing OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 has different effects on the differentiation TGs, depending on the type of architecture which applies: with option I, decreasing OCT4&#x02013;SOX2, from a high level, at which the differentiation genes are repressed, first leads to an increase in expression of the differentiation TGs, as the OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 level passes through the maximum of the amplitude filter curve (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g007">Figure 7</xref>A), then passes through the linear region, and finally decreases to zero. With option II, the gene expression jumps to a high value and thereafter remains almost constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). These two predictions require that the expression levels of the TGs be measured as a function of the dosage of the signal <italic>A</italic>

Perhaps a more favorable option would be to measure the above with respect to a signal which shuts <sc>off</sc> NANOG, similar to the effects of p53 as seen in mouse ES cells.</p><p>The model suffers from a few deficiencies. Overexpression of OCT4 initiates differentiation [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]; similarly, expression of NANOG initiates differentiation in mouse [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and this is not taken into account into our model. Also, it is likely that the target stem cell genes are also involved in transcriptional control of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Given that OCT4 also binds to some downstream genes individually, not always together with the SOX2 and NANOG [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], one can easily imagine mechanisms to account for what is observed in [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, there is insufficient knowledge available for a falsifiable extension of the model to explain this effect.</p><p>Future work will elaborate on the effects of stochastic fluctuations in protein concentration of NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 on the regulatory behavior of the TGs. Bistability is one way to counter chatter in input noise [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and hence we expect that the bistable behavior of the stem cell box should be robust to input environmental fluctuations compared with the case where it is ultrasensitive [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Preliminary analysis of the incoherent feedforward nature of the regulation shows that along with the amplitude filtering of a signal, noise in the OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 input as well as NANOG fluctuations contribute significantly to the TG output noise. It is therefore likely that TGs must have significant feedback mechanisms to suppress the noise, but yet to be responsive to the signal. Finally, recent computational modeling [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] has shown how it is possible to combine single cell behavior to population dynamics by studying effects of external factors. A better understanding of the core transcriptional dynamics will aid in such population studies, thereby etching out a clearer picture of pathways that control stem cell self-renewal/pluripotency and differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A stoichiometric map for more detailed model considerations corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g013">Figure 13</xref>.

For small molecule numbers, one can use Monte Carlo simulations of the Master Equation [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, in our case, it appears that the number of transcripts involved is about 50 to 100 [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which should be a sufficient number for a deterministic approach. A commonly used approach for deterministic models is to use Michaelis&#x02013;Menten equations or variants thereof, e.g., Hill equations. We follow the Shea&#x02013;Ackers formalism [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], described in detail for several kinds of gene regulation in [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The advantage here is the transparency of the relative importance of the different interactions between TFs and RNAP and the close relationship between the theory and the experiment. We explicitly consider the binding/absence of TF and RNAP at the gene promoter region, such that it is easy to convert the combinatorial approach taken here to a particular reaction scheme. We re-derive this well-known result for the sake of completeness in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020123-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><p>We assume that the process of binding/unbinding of TFs and RNAP takes place over a time scale much smaller than the rate of change of the concentrations of all the proteins in the network. This corresponds to thermodynamic equilibrium at the promoter region of each gene. The transcription rate is then given by the fraction of cases when the RNAP is bound. We compute the partition function [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] by enumerating all the possible cases by which the different combinations of proteins bind to the gene. For the OCT4 and SOX2 genes, we assume four binding sites corresponding to (i) the signal TF (<italic>A</italic>
<sub>+</sub>), (ii) the heterodimer OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 (<italic>OS</italic>), (iii) NANOG (<italic>N</italic>), and (iv) the RNAP enzyme (<italic>R</italic>). There are sixteen possible combinations by which these four proteins can bind to the DNA. The same holds for NANOG, where in addition to OCT4&#x02013;SOX2, NANOG, and RNAP, we also assume the existence of a signal <italic>B</italic>
<sub>&#x02212;</sub>, which has the effect of suppressing NANOG (similar to the effect that p53 has on mouse ESC). We model the stem cell and differentiating downstream TGs as being regulated by OCT4&#x02013;SOX2, NANOG, and RNAP. Hence they have three binding sites and eight possible combinations by which various combinations of proteins can bind. For each such combination there is an associated free energy of binding &#x003b4;<italic>G</italic>. The transcription rate is proportional to the relative probability that the polymerase is bound to the gene. This probability can be computed using the partition function, which for OCT4 and SOX2 regulation reads

If one has access to sufficient dynamical measurements in terms of time series, one could in principle determine the parameters. For the ES cell switch, this is not the case. However, with some information about the nature of the interactions and the requirement of switch behavior, it is natural to assume that the interactions are dominated by a few terms and to evaluate the consequences of the assumption including features such as robustness. More specifically we assume that NANOG cannot bind to the OCT4 and SOX2, unless recruited by the OCT4&#x02013;SOX2 complex. Also it is reasonable to assume that the signal <italic>A</italic>

A more detailed model&#x02014;which assumes that OCT4 first binds to the DNA, recruits SOX2, and then this further recruits either RNAP, or NANOG, the latter as a repressor&#x02014;yields qualitatively the same type of dynamics.

All <italic>n</italic>-node subgraphs are enumerated, and based on the interactions between the constituent genes, each subgraph is expressed in a canonical form with respect to permutations of the <italic>n</italic> labels. Finally, all but the subgraphs of interest are filtered out.</p><p>Reducing the network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref> to pure gene&#x02013;gene interactions yields a maximally connected three-node directed network as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. We searched for occurrences of this network in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> transcriptional network from the Web site related to [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> transcriptional network of the yeast proteome database [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> network derived from GeNet [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, none of these searches resulted in any matches. In fact, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> network does not contain any pairs of mutually regulating genes, and we therefore disregard it for most of this discussion. This apparent lack of mutual regulation may seem strange, but recall that we only consider interactions at the transcriptional level. Protein&#x02013;protein interactions play a complementary role [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and might be particularly important in small, fast-paced organisms such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>.</p><p>Widening our search by removing autoregulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) does not make any difference for the yeast network, but in <italic>Drosophila</italic> we then find a single match. This match corresponds to Kr&#x000fc;ppel, Knirps, and Giant, three genes involved in early embryonic development. Although structurally similar (except for the autoregulation), the OCT4/SOX2/NANOG and Kr&#x000fc;ppel/Knirps/Giant subnetworks contain radically different interactions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>).</p><p>In a further attempt to find architectural elements similar to the stem cell box, we searched for pairs of mutually activating genes, preferably also activating themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This subgraph would correspond to a minimal version of the stem cell switch, without the redundancy of having both OCT4 and SOX2. The closest match in the yeast network consists of CAT5 and CAT8, which act as activators for each other. Additionally, CAT5 activates itself. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the same relationship exists between achaete and scute. We also note that the human hematopoietic switch consisting of the genes <italic>PU.1</italic> and <italic>GATA1</italic> looks much like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, in which <italic>PU.1</italic> and <italic>GATA1</italic> upregulate themselves, but repress each other, essentially resulting in a bistable switch, which separates two differentiation paths in hematopoietic stem cells [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The symmetry between the two final states here contrasts to the asymmetry between the two states of the stem cell box.</p><p>Finally, since a series of two repressions in some sense amounts to a positive regulation, we expanded the search to include the motif shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020123-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, where the presence of A prevents B from repressing C, thus making C follow A. No instances of this type of mutual activation were found in yeast, but in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> dataset it appeared three times, involving the genes <italic>engrailed</italic> and <italic>hedgehog</italic>. However, these two genes are highly connected in the regulatory network, and many other genes could affect the would-be switches to the point where their behavior is far different from that of a simple bistable switch.</p></sec><sec id="s4X0X5"><title>Simulations.</title><p>All simulations were carried out using the Systems Biology Workbench (SBW/BioSPICE) tools [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]: the network designer JDesigner, the simulation engine Jarnac [<xref rid="pcbi-0020123-b061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].
