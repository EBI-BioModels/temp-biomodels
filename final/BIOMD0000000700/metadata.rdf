    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Human cells that suffer mild DNA damage can enter a
    reversible state of growth arrest known as quiescence. This
    decision to temporarily exit the cell cycle is essential to
    prevent the propagation of mutations, and most cancer cells
    harbor defects in the underlying control system. Here we
    present a mechanistic mathematical model to study the
    proliferation-quiescence decision in nontransformed human
    cells. We show that two bistable switches, the restriction
    point (RP) and the G1/S transition, mediate this decision by
    integrating DNA damage and mitogen signals. In particular, our
    data suggest that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21
    (Cip1/Waf1), which is expressed in response to DNA damage,
    promotes quiescence by blocking positive feedback loops that
    facilitate G1 progression downstream of serum stimulation.
    Intriguingly, cells exploit bistability in the RP to convert
    graded p21 and mitogen signals into an all-or-nothing
    cell-cycle response. The same mechanism creates a window of
    opportunity where G1 cells that have passed the RP can revert
    to quiescence if exposed to DNA damage. We present experimental
    evidence that cells gradually lose this ability to revert to
    quiescence as they progress through G1 and that the onset of
    rapid p21 degradation at the G1/S transition prevents this
    response altogether, insulating S phase from mild, endogenous
    DNA damage. Thus, two bistable switches conspire in the early
    cell cycle to provide both sensitivity and robustness to
    external stimuli.</p>
