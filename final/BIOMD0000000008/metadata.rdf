    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>We demonstrate, by using mathematical modeling of cell
    division cycle (CDC) dynamics, a potential mechanism for
    precisely controlling the frequency of cell division and
    regulating the size of a dividing cell. Control of the cell
    cycle is achieved by artificially expressing a protein that
    reversibly binds and inactivates any one of the CDC proteins.
    In the simplest case, such as the checkpoint-free situation
    encountered in early amphibian embryos, the frequency of CDC
    oscillations can be increased or decreased by regulating the
    rate of synthesis, the binding rate, or the equilibrium
    constant of the binding protein. In a more complex model of
    cell division, where size-control checkpoints are included, we
    show that the same reversible binding reaction can alter the
    mean cell mass in a continuously dividing cell. Because this
    control scheme is general and requires only the expression of a
    single protein, it provides a practical means for tuning the
    characteristics of the cell cycle in vivo.</p>
