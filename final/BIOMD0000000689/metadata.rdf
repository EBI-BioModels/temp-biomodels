    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Tetrahydrofolate (THF) and its one-carbon derivatives,
    collectively termed folates, are essential cofactors, but are
    inherently unstable. While it is clear that chemical oxidation
    can cleave folates or damage their pterin precursors, very
    little is known about enzymatic damage to these molecules or
    about whether the folate biosynthesis pathway responds
    adaptively to damage to its end-products. The presence of a
    duplication of the gene encoding the folate biosynthesis enzyme
    6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (FolK) in
    many sequenced bacterial genomes combined with a strong
    chromosomal clustering of the folK gene with panB, encoding the
    5,10-methylene-THF-dependent enzyme ketopantoate
    hydroxymethyltransferase, led us to infer that PanB has a side
    activity that cleaves 5,10-methylene-THF, yielding a pterin
    product that is recycled by FolK. Genetic and metabolic
    analyses of Escherichia coli strains showed that overexpression
    of PanB leads to accumulation of the likely folate cleavage
    product 6-hydroxymethylpterin and other pterins in cells and
    medium, and-unexpectedly-to a 46% increase in total folate
    content. In silico modeling of the folate biosynthesis pathway
    showed that these observations are consistent with the in vivo
    cleavage of 5,10-methylene-THF by a side-activity of PanB, with
    FolK-mediated recycling of the pterin cleavage product, and
    with regulation of folate biosynthesis by folates or their
    damage products.</p>
