  <p>This model encoded according to the paper      <i>Cross-talk and decision making in MAP kinase pathways.</i>
          Supplementary Figure 2 has been reproduced by COPASI4.0.20 (development) using parameter scan method. You probably need to uncheck &quot;always use initial conditions&quot; in copasi when you simulate for the second run in order to get the figure. S1 scale from 0 to 12. Keep in mind that the y axis is the fractions of  excited X3 and Y3, meaning that X3P and Y3P are normalized by total concentration X3T and Y3T.      </p>
  <p>The results from modeling the pathway in Supplementary Figure1a, including both activation and inhibition. According to the paper, the value of ka and kd should in the orange region (ka belongs [0,1], kd belongs [1,10]) so assigned ka=0, kd=1.</p>
  <p>The author made the simplifying assumption that the interactions between the pathways are symmetric. Thus the k12xy=k12yx=ka, k33xy=k33yx=kd.</p>
