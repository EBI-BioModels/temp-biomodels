  <p class="p1">O&apos;Dea, E.L., Barken, D., Peralta, R.Q., Tran K.T., Werner, S.L., Kearns, J.D., Levchenko, A., Hoffmann, A. A homeostatic model of IkB metabolism to control constitutive activity. Molecular Systems Biology, 3:111, pp. 1-7. 2007<br/></p>
  <p class="p1">Questions concerning the paper should be addressed to the corresponding author. Alexander Hoffmann (ahoffmann@ucsd.edu)</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="p1">The original model was written and simulated within MathWorks MatLab 2006a using the ode15s (stiff/NDF) solver. It is highly recommended that those wanting to model this system use the MatLab version which we will freely provide upon request. As always, simulation results vary according to the numerical solver used.</p>
  <p>Translation to SBML Level 2.1 was performed via reconstruction of the model within MathWorks SimBiology Desktop (version 2.1) followed by an Export to SBML. Please address questions about this SBML model to Jeff Kearns (jkearns@ucsd.edu).</p>
  <p>BioModels DB curation: The model reproduces the values of diffferent species depicted in Fig 3A and 3B (wt) of the paper corresponding to Model1.1. To depict the the total IkB alpha, beta epsilon species, three additional parameters and their corresponding assignment rules have been introduced in this model by the creator. Model succesfully tested on MathSBML. </p>
