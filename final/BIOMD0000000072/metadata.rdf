  <p>The paper describes both wild-type and mutant cells of G protein cycle by using different values of G protein deactivation. We chosed the wild-type, k=0.11 s-1.</p>
  <p>The unit of the concentration for the proteins are numbers of molecules per cell.</p>
  <p>Figure5(A) was reproduced with COPASI 4.0 (Build 18) and SBML_odeSolver. Figure5(B) was reproduced with COPASI 4.0 (Build 18).</p>
