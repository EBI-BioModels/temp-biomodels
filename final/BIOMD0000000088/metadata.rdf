    dc:description """<body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>The model reproduces Fig 2B, D, F, and 2H. The dynamics correspond to a stimulus of 1 U/ml of thrombin which is equal to 0.01 uM. Phosphorylated MLC is the sum of pMLC (s359) and ppMLC (s360). A slight discrepancy in peak values of species between the figure in the paper and simulation result might be due to different initial conditions in the two sets.  The model was successfully tested on MathSBML. It is possible to simulate the model on other software that do not support &quot;Events&quot; at this time by removing the &quot;listOfEvents&quot; and substituting a value of 0.01 for thrombin (s2). This does not change the model very much. With the latter format, the model was also successfully tested on Copasi.</p>
