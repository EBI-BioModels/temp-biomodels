    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>We present a hypothesis for the loss of acetylcholine in
    Alzheimer&apos;s disease that is based on two recent experimental
    results: that beta-amyloid causes leakage of choline across
    cell membranes and that decreased production of acetylcholine
    increases the production of beta-amyloid. According to the
    hypothesis, an increase in beta-amyloid concentration caused by
    proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein results in an
    increase in the leakage of choline out of cells. This leads to
    a reduction in intracellular choline concentration and hence a
    reduction in acetylcholine production. The reduction in
    acetylcholine production, in turn, causes an increase in the
    concentration of beta-amyloid. The resultant positive feedback
    between decreased acetylcholine and increased beta-amyloid
    accelerates the loss of acetylcholine. We compare the
    predictions of the choline-leakage hypothesis with a number of
    experimental observations. We also approximate it with a pair
    of ordinary differential equations. The solutions of these
    equations indicate that the loss of acetylcholine is very
    sensitive to the initial rate of beta-amyloid production.</p>
