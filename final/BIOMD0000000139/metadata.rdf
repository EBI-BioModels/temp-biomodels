  <p>The model corresponds to the knock out model of beta-/-, epsilon -/- and reproduces the upper panel in Fig 2C. In order to reproduce the other knock out models the transcription rate of the species that are not present must be set to zero and the rate of the one that is present must be set as seven times its corresponding value for the wild type model. This is done so as to compensate for the loss of other isoforms.  Model was successfully tested on MathSBML.</p>
