    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Previous article on the integrative modelling of Parkinson&apos;s
    disease (PD) described a mathematical model with properties
    suggesting that PD pathogenesis is associated with a
    feedback-induced biochemical bistability. In this article, the
    authors show that the dynamics of the mathematical model can be
    extracted and distilled into an equivalent two-state feedback
    motif whose stability properties are controlled by
    multi-factorial combinations of risk factors and genetic
    mutations associated with PD. Based on this finding, the
    authors propose a principle for PD pathogenesis in the form of
    the switch-like transition of a bistable feedback process from
    &apos;healthy&apos; homeostatic levels of reactive oxygen species and the
    protein ?-synuclein, to an alternative &apos;disease&apos; state in which
    concentrations of both molecules are stable at the damagingly
    high-levels associated with PD. The bistability is analysed
    using the rate curves and steady-state response characteristics
    of the feedback motif. In particular, the authors show how a
    bifurcation in the feedback motif marks the pathogenic moment
    at which the &apos;healthy&apos; state is lost and the &apos;disease&apos; state is
    initiated. Further analysis shows how known risks (such as:
    age, toxins and genetic predisposition) modify the stability
    characteristics of the feedback motif in a way that is
    compatible with known features of PD, and which explain
    properties such as: multi-factorial causality, variability in
    susceptibility and severity, multi-timescale progression and
    the special cases of familial Parkinson&apos;s and Parkinsonian
    symptoms induced purely by toxic stress.</p>
