    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Vertebrate visual phototransduction is perhaps the most
    well-studied G-protein signaling pathway. A wealth of available
    biochemical and electrophysiological data has resulted in a
    rich history of mathematical modeling of the system. However,
    while the most comprehensive models have relied upon amphibian
    biochemical and electrophysiological data, modern research
    typically employs mammalian species, particularly mice, which
    exhibit significantly faster signaling dynamics. In this work,
    we present an adaptation of a previously published,
    comprehensive model of amphibian phototransduction that can
    produce quantitatively accurate simulations of the murine
    photoresponse. We demonstrate the ability of the model to
    predict responses to a wide range of stimuli and under a
    variety of mutant conditions. Finally, we employ the model to
    highlight a likely unknown mechanism related to the interaction
    between rhodopsin and rhodopsin kinase.</p>
