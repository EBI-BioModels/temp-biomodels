    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Plasmin (PLS) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (UPA)
    are ubiquitous proteases that regulate the extracellular
    environment. Although they are secreted in inactive forms, they
    can activate each other through proteolytic cleavage. This
    mutual interplay creates the potential for complex dynamics,
    which we investigated using mathematical modeling and in vitro
    experiments. We constructed ordinary differential equations to
    model the conversion of precursor plasminogen into active PLS,
    and precursor urokinase (scUPA) into active urokinase (tcUPA).
    Although neither PLS nor UPA exhibits allosteric cooperativity,
    modeling showed that cooperativity occurred at the system level
    because of substrate competition. Computational simulations and
    bifurcation analysis predicted that the system would be
    bistable over a range of parameters for cooperativity and
    positive feedback. Cell-free experiments with recombinant
    proteins tested key predictions of the model. PLS activation in
    response to scUPA stimulus was found to be cooperative in
    vitro. Finally, bistability was demonstrated in vitro by the
    presence of two significantly different steady-state levels of
    PLS activation for the same levels of stimulus. We conclude
    that ultrasensitive, bistable activation of UPA-PLS is possible
    in the presence of substrate competition. An ultrasensitive
    threshold for activation of PLS and UPA would have
    ramifications for normal and disease processes, including
    angiogenesis, metastasis, wound healing, and fibrosis.</p>
