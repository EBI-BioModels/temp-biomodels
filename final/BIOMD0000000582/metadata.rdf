    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Cellular senescence, a state of irreversible cell cycle
    arrest, is thought to help protect an organism from cancer, yet
    also contributes to ageing. The changes which occur in
    senescence are controlled by networks of multiple signalling
    and feedback pathways at the cellular level, and the interplay
    between these is difficult to predict and understand. To
    unravel the intrinsic challenges of understanding such a highly
    networked system, we have taken a systems biology approach to
    cellular senescence. We report a detailed analysis of
    senescence signalling via DNA damage, insulin-TOR, FoxO3a
    transcription factors, oxidative stress response, mitochondrial
    regulation and mitophagy. We show in silico and in vitro that
    inhibition of reactive oxygen species can prevent loss of
    mitochondrial membrane potential, whilst inhibition of mTOR
    shows a partial rescue of mitochondrial mass changes during
    establishment of senescence. Dual inhibition of ROS and mTOR in
    vitro confirmed computational model predictions that it was
    possible to further reduce senescence-induced mitochondrial
    dysfunction and DNA double-strand breaks. However, these
    interventions were unable to abrogate the senescence-induced
    mitochondrial dysfunction completely, and we identified
    decreased mitochondrial fission as the potential driving force
    for increased mitochondrial mass via prevention of mitophagy.
    Dynamic sensitivity analysis of the model showed the network
    stabilised at a new late state of cellular senescence. This was
    characterised by poor network sensitivity, high signalling
    noise, low cellular energy, high inflammation and permanent
    cell cycle arrest suggesting an unsatisfactory outcome for
    treatments aiming to delay or reverse cellular senescence at
    late time points. Combinatorial targeted interventions are
    therefore possible for intervening in the cellular pathway to
    senescence, but in the cases identified here, are only capable
    of delaying senescence onset.</p>
