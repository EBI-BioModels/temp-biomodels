    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The purpose of this study is to model the dynamics of
    lobular Ca(2+) wave propagation induced by an extracellular
    stimulus, and to analyze the effect of spatially systematic
    variations in cell-intrinsic signaling parameters on sinusoidal
    Ca(2+) response.We developed a computational model of lobular
    scale Ca(2+) signaling that accounts for receptor- mediated
    initiation of cell-intrinsic Ca(2+) signal in hepatocytes and
    its propagation to neighboring hepatocytes through gap
    junction-mediated molecular exchange.Analysis of the
    simulations showed that a pericentral-to-periportal spatial
    gradient in hormone sensitivity and/or rates of IP3 synthesis
    underlies the Ca(2+) wave propagation. We simulated specific
    cases corresponding to localized disruptions in the graded
    pattern of these parameters along a hepatic sinusoid.
    Simulations incorporating locally altered parameters exhibited
    Ca(2+) waves that do not propagate throughout the hepatic
    plate. Increased gap junction coupling restored normal Ca(2+)
    wave propagation when hepatocytes with low Ca(2+) signaling
    ability were localized in the midlobular or the pericentral
    region.Multiple spatial patterns in intracellular signaling
    parameters can lead to Ca(2+) wave propagation that is
    consistent with the experimentally observed spatial patterns of
    Ca(2+) dynamics. Based on simulations and analysis, we predict
    that increased gap junction-mediated intercellular coupling can
    induce robust Ca(2+) signals in otherwise poorly responsive
    hepatocytes, at least partly restoring the sinusoidally
    oriented Ca (2+) waves.Our bottom-up model of agonist-evoked
    spatial Ca(2+) patterns can be integrated with detailed
    descriptions of liver histology to study Ca(2+) regulation at
    the tissue level.</p>
