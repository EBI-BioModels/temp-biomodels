  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
          The electrical activity of insulin-secreting pancreatic islets of Langerhans is
characterized by bursts of action potentials. Most often this bursting is
periodic, but in some cases it is modulated by an underlying slower rhythm. We
suggest that the modulatory rhythm for this complex bursting pattern is due to
oscillations in glycolysis, while the bursting itself is generated by some other
slow process. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we couple a minimal model of
glycolytic oscillations to a minimal model for activity-dependent bursting in
islets. We show that the combined model can reproduce several complex bursting
patterns from mouse islets published in the literature, and we illustrate how
these complex oscillations are produced through the use of a fast/slow analysis.      </p>
  <p>This model was taken from the      <a href="http://www.cellml.org/models">CellML repository</a>
          and automatically converted to SBML.      <br/>
