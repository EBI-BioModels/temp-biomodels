Strategies in regulating glioblastoma signaling pathways and anti-invasion therapy

Abstract:
Glioblastoma multiforme is one of the most invasive type of glial tumors, which rapidly grows and commonly spreads into nearby brain tissue. It is a devastating brain cancer that often results in death within approximately 12 to 15 months after diagnosis. In this work, optimal control theory was applied to regulate intracellular signaling pathways of miR-451–AMPK–mTOR–cell cycle dynamics via glucose and drug intravenous administration infusions. Glucose level is controlled to activate miR-451 in the up-stream pathway of the model. A potential drug blocking the inhibitory pathway of mTOR by AMPK complex is incorporated to explore regulation of the down-stream pathway to the cell cycle. Both miR-451 and mTOR levels are up-regulated inducing cell proliferation and reducing invasion in the neighboring tissues. Concomitant and alternating glucose and drug infusions are explored under various circumstances to predict best clinical outcomes with least administration costs.</p>
