  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
          Apoptosis in response to TRAIL or TNF requires the activation of initiator
	caspases, which then activate the effector caspases that dismantle
	cells and cause death. However, little is known about the dynamics
	and regulatory logic linking initiators and effectors. Using a combination
	of live-cell reporters, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting, we find
	that initiator caspases are active during the long and variable delay
	that precedes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP)
	and effector caspase activation. When combined with a mathematical
	model of core apoptosis pathways, experimental perturbation of regulatory
	links between initiator and effector caspases reveals that XIAP and
	proteasome-dependent degradation of effector caspases are important
	in restraining activity during the pre-MOMP delay. We identify conditions
	in which restraint is impaired, creating a physiologically indeterminate
	state of partial cell death with the potential to generate genomic
	instability. Together, these findings provide a quantitative picture
	of caspase regulatory networks and their failure modes.      <br/>
          The mitochondrial compartment is just added as a logical partition and its volume is not used in the mathematical formulas, to stick closer to the expressions used in the matlab files distributed with the original publication. There only the rate constants for bimolecular reactions are adapted by division by      <em>v</em>
          , the ration of the volumes of the mitochondrial compartment and the total cell.      <br/>
          For BCL2 overexpression in figure 5, the initial BCL2 amount was increased by a factor 12 to 2.4*10      <sup>5</sup>
          . For siRNA downregulation of XIAP its amount was multiplied by  0.13 to 1.3*10      <sup>4</sup>
          .      </p>
