    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Resistance to targeted cancer therapies such as trastuzumab
    is a frequent clinical problem not solely because of
    insufficient expression of HER2 receptor but also because of
    the overriding activation states of cell signaling pathways.
    Systems biology approaches lend themselves to rapid in silico
    testing of factors, which may confer resistance to targeted
    therapies. Inthis study, we aimed to develop a new kinetic
    model that could be interrogated to predict resistance to
    receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor therapies and directly
    test predictions in vitro and in clinical samples. The new
    mathematical model included RTK inhibitor antibody binding,
    HER2/HER3 dimerization and inhibition, AKT/mitogen-activated
    protein kinase cross-talk, and the regulatory properties of
    PTEN. The model was parameterized using quantitative
    phosphoprotein expression data from cancer cell lines using
    reverse-phase protein microarrays. Quantitative PTEN protein
    expression was found to be the key determinant of resistance to
    anti-HER2 therapy in silico, which was predictive of unseen
    experiments in vitro using the PTEN inhibitor bp(V). When
    measured in cancer cell lines, PTEN expression predicts
    sensitivity to anti-HER2 therapy; furthermore, this
    quantitative measurement is more predictive of response
    (relative risk, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-5.5; P &lt;
    0.0001) than other pathway components taken in isolation and
    when tested by multivariate analysis in a cohort of 122 breast
    cancers treated with trastuzumab. For the first time, a systems
    biology approach has successfully been used to stratify
    patients for personalized therapy in cancer and is further
    compelling evidence that PTEN, appropriately measured in the
    clinical setting, refines clinical decision making in patients
    treated with anti-HER2 therapies.</p>
