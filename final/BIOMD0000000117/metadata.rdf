  <p>This model is according to the paper      <i>Signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations: Properties of a model based on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release.</i>
          Figure4B in the paper has been reproduced by RoadRunner and MathSBML. Damped Ca2+ oscillations elicited by a transient pulse of InsP3 applied intracellularly to a resting, non-oscillatory cell.      </p>
