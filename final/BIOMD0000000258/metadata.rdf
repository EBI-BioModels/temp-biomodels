    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Previous studies have suggested that positive feedback loops
    and ultrasensitivity are prerequisites for bistability in
    covalent modification cascades. However, it was recently shown
    that bistability and hysteresis can also arise solely from
    multisite phosphorylation. Here we analytically demonstrate
    that double phosphorylation of a protein (or other covalent
    modification) generates bistability only if: (a) the two
    phosphorylation (or the two dephosphorylation) reactions are
    catalyzed by the same enzyme; (b) the kinetics operate at least
    partly in the zero-order region; and (c) the ratio of the
    catalytic constants of the phosphorylation and
    dephosphorylation steps in the first modification cycle is less
    than this ratio in the second cycle. We also show that
    multisite phosphorylation enlarges the region of kinetic
    parameter values in which bistability appears, but does not
    generate multistability. In addition, we conclude that a
    cascade of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles generates
    multiple steady states in the absence of feedback or
    feedforward loops. Our results show that bistable behavior in
    covalent modification cascades relies not only on the structure
    and regulatory pattern of feedback/feedforward loops, but also
    on the kinetic characteristics of their component proteins.</p>
