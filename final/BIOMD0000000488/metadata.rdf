    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Progress in the development of therapeutic interventions to
    treat or slow the progression of Alzheimer&apos;s disease has been
    hampered by lack of efficacy and unforeseen side effects in
    human clinical trials. This setback highlights the need for new
    approaches for pre-clinical testing of possible interventions.
    Systems modelling is becoming increasingly recognised as a
    valuable tool for investigating molecular and cellular
    mechanisms involved in ageing and age-related diseases.
    However, there is still a lack of awareness of modelling
    approaches in many areas of biomedical research. We previously
    developed a stochastic computer model to examine some of the
    key pathways involved in the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ)
    and the micro-tubular binding protein tau. Here we show how we
    extended this model to include the main processes involved in
    passive and active immunisation against Aβ and then demonstrate
    the effects of this intervention on soluble Aβ, plaques,
    phosphorylated tau and tangles. The model predicts that
    immunisation leads to clearance of plaques but only results in
    small reductions in levels of soluble Aβ, phosphorylated tau
    and tangles. The behaviour of this model is supported by
    neuropathological observations in Alzheimer patients immunised
    against Aβ. Since, soluble Aβ, phosphorylated tau and tangles
    more closely correlate with cognitive decline than plaques, our
    model suggests that immunotherapy against Aβ may not be
    effective unless it is performed very early in the disease
    process or combined with other therapies.</p>
