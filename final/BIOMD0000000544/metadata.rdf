    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>BACKGROUND: Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-6
    (IL-6) are multifunctional cytokines that regulate immune
    responses, cell proliferation, and tumour development and
    progression, which frequently have functionally opposing roles.
    The cellular responses to both cytokines are activated via the
    Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription
    (JAK/STAT) pathway. During the past 10 years, the crosstalk
    mechanism between the IFN-gamma and IL-6 pathways has been
    studied widely and several biological hypotheses have been
    proposed, but the kinetics and detailed crosstalk mechanism
    remain unclear. RESULTS: Using established mathematical models
    and new experimental observations of the crosstalk between the
    IFN-gamma and IL-6 pathways, we constructed a new crosstalk
    model that considers three possible crosstalk levels: (1) the
    competition between STAT1 and STAT3 for common receptor docking
    sites; (2) the mutual negative regulation between SOCS1 and
    SOCS3; and (3) the negative regulatory effects of the formation
    of STAT1/3 heterodimers. A number of simulations were tested to
    explore the consequences of cross-regulation between the two
    pathways. The simulation results agreed well with the
    experimental data, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness and
    correctness of the model. CONCLUSION: In this study, we
    developed a crosstalk model of the IFN-gamma and IL-6 pathways
    to theoretically investigate their cross-regulation mechanism.
    The simulation experiments showed the importance of the three
    crosstalk levels between the two pathways. In particular, the
    unbalanced competition between STAT1 and STAT3 for IFNR and
    gp130 led to preferential activation of IFN-gamma and IL-6,
    while at the same time the formation of STAT1/3 heterodimers
    enhanced preferential signal transduction by sequestering a
    fraction of the activated STATs. The model provided a good
    explanation of the experimental observations and provided
    insights that may inform further research to facilitate a
    better understanding of the cross-regulation mechanism between
    the two pathways.</p>
