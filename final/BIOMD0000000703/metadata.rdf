    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The vertebrate unfolded protein response (UPR) is
    characterized by multiple interacting nodes among its three
    pathways, yet the logic underlying this regulatory complexity
    is unclear. To begin to address this issue, we created a
    computational model of the vertebrate UPR that was entrained
    upon and then validated against experimental data. As part of
    this validation, the model successfully predicted the
    phenotypes of cells with lesions in UPR signaling, including a
    surprising and previously unreported differential role for the
    eIF2? phosphatase GADD34 in exacerbating severe stress but
    ameliorating mild stress. We then used the model to test the
    functional importance of a feed-forward circuit within the
    PERK/CHOP axis, and of cross-regulatory control of BiP and CHOP
    expression. We found that the wiring structure of the UPR
    appears to balance the ability of the response to remain
    sensitive to ER stress yet also to be rapidly deactivated by
    improved protein folding conditions. This model should serve as
    a valuable resource for further exploring the regulatory logic
    of the UPR.</p>
