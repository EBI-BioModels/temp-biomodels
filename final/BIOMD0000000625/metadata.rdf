    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a highly plastic subset
    of CD4+ T cells specialized in providing B cell help and
    promoting inflammatory and effector responses during infectious
    and immune-mediate diseases. Helicobacter pylori is the
    dominant member of the gastric microbiota and exerts both
    beneficial and harmful effects on the host. Chronic
    inflammation in the context of H. pylori has been linked to an
    upregulation in T helper (Th)1 and Th17 CD4+ T cell phenotypes,
    controlled in part by the cytokine, interleukin-21. This study
    investigates the differentiation and regulation of Tfh cells,
    major producers of IL-21, in the immune response to H. pylori
    challenge. To better understand the conditions influencing the
    promotion and inhibition of a chronically elevated Tfh
    population, we used top-down and bottom-up approaches to
    develop computational models of Tfh and T follicular regulatory
    (Tfr) cell differentiation. Stability analysis was used to
    characterize the presence of two bi-stable steady states in the
    calibrated Tfh/Tfr models. Stochastic simulation was used to
    illustrate the ability of the parameter set to dictate two
    distinct behavioral patterns. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis
    helped identify the importance of various parameters on the
    establishment of Tfh and Tfr cell populations. The core network
    model was expanded into a more comprehensive and predictive
    model by including cytokine production and signaling pathways.
    From the expanded network, the interaction between TGFB-Induced
    Factor Homeobox 1 (Tgif1) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) was
    displayed to exert control over the determination of the Tfh
    response. Model simulations predict that Tgif1 and RXR
    respectively induce and curtail Tfh responses. This
    computational hypothesis was validated experimentally by
    assaying Tgif1, RXR and Tfh in stomachs of mice infected with
    H. pylori.</p>

  <div class="bm:curation">The impulse of RXR as shown in the paper
(figure 7C) can be implemented by creating an event in the curated
SBML file.
