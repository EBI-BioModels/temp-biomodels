  &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
          Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) responses are required to fight many diseases such
as viral infections and tumors. At the same time, they can cause disease when
induced inappropriately. Which factors regulate CTL and decide whether they
should remain silent or react is open to debate. The phenomenon called
cross-priming has received attention in this respect. That is, CTL expansion
occurs if antigen is recognized on the surface of professional antigen
presenting cells (APCs). This is in contrast to direct presentation where
antigen is seen on the surface of the target cells (e.g. infected cells or tumor
cells). Here we introduce a mathematical model, which takes the phenomenon of
cross-priming into account. We propose a new mechanism of regulation which is
implicit in the dynamics of the CTL: According to the model, the ability of a
CTL response to become established depends on the ratio of cross-presentation to
direct presentation of the antigen. If this ratio is relatively high, CTL
responses are likely to become established. If this ratio is relatively low,
tolerance is the likely outcome. The behavior of the model includes a parameter
region where the outcome depends on the initial conditions. We discuss our
results with respect to the idea of self/non-self discrimination and the danger
signal hypothesis. We apply the model to study the role of CTL in cancer
initiation, cancer evolution/progression, and therapeutic vaccination against
cancers.      &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This model was taken from the      &lt;a href="http://www.cellml.org/models"&gt;CellML repository&lt;/a&gt;
          and automatically converted to SBML.      &lt;br/&gt;
          The original model was:      &lt;a href="http://models.cellml.org/exposure/7113cad8414646c526728e1a7d68e13b"&gt;
