Abstract: 
TGF-β is an immunoregulatory protein that contributes to inadequate antitumor immune responses in cancer patients. Recent experimental data suggests that TGF-β inhibition alone, provides few clinical benefits, yet it can significantly amplify the anti-tumor immune response when combined with a tumor vaccine. We develop a mathematical model in order to gain insight into the cooperative interaction between anti-TGF-β and vaccine treatments. The mathematical model follows the dynamics of the tumor size, TGF-β concentration, activated cytotoxic effector cells, and regulatory T cells. Using numerical simulations and stability analysis, we study the following scenarios: a control case of no treatment, anti-TGF-β treatment, vaccine treatment, and combined anti-TGF-β vaccine treatments. We show that our model is capable of capturing the observed experimental results, and hence can be potentially used in designing future experiments involving this approach to immunotherapy.
