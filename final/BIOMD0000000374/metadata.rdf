  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
S. Bordin and colleagues have proposed that the depolarizing effects of
acetylcholine and other muscarinic agonists on pancreatic beta-cells are
mediated by a calcium release-activated current (CRAC). We support this
hypothesis with additional data, and present a theoretical model which accounts
for most known data on muscarinic effects. Additional phenomena, such as the
biphasic responses of beta-cells to changes in glucose concentration and the
depolarizing effects of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump
poison thapsigargin, are also accounted for by our model. The ability of this
single hypothesis, that CRAC is present in beta-cells, to explain so many
phenomena motivates a more complete characterization of this current.

This model was taken from the
      <a href="http://www.cellml.org/models">CellML repository</a> and automatically converted to SBML.
