    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein ubiquitous in
    eukaryotic cells, involved in numerous calcium-regulated
    biological phenomena, such as synaptic plasticity, muscle
    contraction, cell cycle, and circadian rhythms. It exibits a
    characteristic dumbell shape, with two globular domains (N- and
    C-terminal lobe) joined by a linker region. Each lobe can take
    alternative conformations, affected by the binding of calcium
    and target proteins. Calmodulin displays considerable
    functional flexibility due to its capability to bind different
    targets, often in a tissue-specific fashion. In various
    specific physiological environments (e.g. skeletal muscle,
    neuron dendritic spines) several targets compete for the same
    calmodulin pool, regulating its availability and affinity for
    calcium. In this work, we sought to understand the general
    principles underlying calmodulin modulation by different target
    proteins, and to account for simultaneous effects of multiple
    competing targets, thus enabling a more realistic simulation of
    calmodulin-dependent pathways. We built a mechanistic
    allosteric model of calmodulin, based on an hemiconcerted
    framework: each calmodulin lobe can exist in two conformations
    in thermodynamic equilibrium, with different affinities for
    calcium and different affinities for each target. Each lobe was
    allowed to switch conformation on its own. The model was
    parameterised and validated against experimental data from the
    literature. In spite of its simplicity, a two-state allosteric
    model was able to satisfactorily represent several sets of
    experiments, in particular the binding of calcium on intact and
    truncated calmodulin and the effect of different skMLCK
    peptides on calmodulin&apos;s saturation curve. The model can also
    be readily extended to include multiple targets. We show that
    some targets stabilise the low calcium affinity T state while
    others stabilise the high affinity R state. Most of the effects
    produced by calmodulin targets can be explained as modulation
    of a pre-existing dynamic equilibrium between different
    conformations of calmodulin&apos;s lobes, in agreement with linkage
    theory and MWC-type models.</p>
