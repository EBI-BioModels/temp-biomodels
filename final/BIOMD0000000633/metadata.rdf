    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Adaptation of the cellular metabolism to varying external
    conditions is brought about by regulated changes in the
    activity of enzymes and transporters. Hormone-dependent
    reversible enzyme phosphorylation and concentration changes of
    reactants and allosteric effectors are the major types of rapid
    kinetic enzyme regulation, whereas on longer time scales
    changes in protein abundance may also become operative. Here,
    we used a comprehensive mathematical model of the hepatic
    glucose metabolism of rat hepatocytes to decipher the relative
    importance of different regulatory modes and their mutual
    interdependencies in the hepatic control of plasma glucose
    homeostasis.Model simulations reveal significant differences in
    the capability of liver metabolism to counteract variations of
    plasma glucose in different physiological settings (starvation,
    ad libitum nutrient supply, diabetes). Changes in enzyme
    abundances adjust the metabolic output to the anticipated
    physiological demand but may turn into a regulatory
    disadvantage if sudden unexpected changes of the external
    conditions occur. Allosteric and hormonal control of enzyme
    activities allow the liver to assume a broad range of metabolic
    states and may even fully reverse flux changes resulting from
    changes of enzyme abundances alone. Metabolic control analysis
    reveals that control of the hepatic glucose metabolism is
    mainly exerted by enzymes alone, which are differently
    controlled by alterations in enzyme abundance, reversible
    phosphorylation, and allosteric effects.In hepatic glucose
    metabolism, regulation of enzyme activities by changes of
    reactants, allosteric effects, and reversible phosphorylation
    is equally important as changes in protein abundance of key
    regulatory enzymes.</p>
