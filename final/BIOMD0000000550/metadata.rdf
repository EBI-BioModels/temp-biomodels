Rheumatoid Arthritis</div>
  <div class="dc:description">This model by Baker M. 2013, describes
the interaction between pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine
signalling in rheumatoid arthritis.
<br/>
  <br/>Using two ordinary differential equations, the first model 
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/anno-model-view.do?mid=BIOMD0000000550">[BIOMD0000000550]</a>
analyses bifurcation and describes different pathological states by
altering inflammatory regulation parameters.
<br/>The second model 
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/anno-model-view.do?mid=BIOMD0000000549">[BIOMD0000000549]</a>
includes the effect that ageing has on pro-inflammatory signalling,
allowing for time-dependant properties and disease progression to
be observed. The author also describes potential dosing for
reversal of the disease state.

    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease
    preferentially affecting the joints and leading, if untreated,
    to progressive joint damage and disability. Cytokines, a group
    of small inducible proteins, which act as intercellular
    messengers, are key regulators of the inflammation that
    characterizes RA. They can be classified into pro-inflammatory
    and anti-inflammatory groups. Numerous cytokines have been
    implicated in the regulation of RA with complex up and down
    regulatory interactions. This paper considers a two-variable
    model for the interactions between pro-inflammatory and
    anti-inflammatory cytokines, and demonstrates that mathematical
    modelling may be used to investigate the involvement of
    cytokines in the disease process. The model displays a range of
    possible behaviours, such as bistability and oscillations,
    which are strongly reminiscent of the behaviour of RA e.g.
    genetic susceptibility and remitting-relapsing disease. We also
    show that the dose regimen as well as the dose level are
    important factors in RA treatments.</p>
