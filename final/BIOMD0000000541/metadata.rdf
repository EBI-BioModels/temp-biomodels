phosphorylation) - model 2</div>
  <div class="dc:description">
    <p>Insulin induces phosphorylation and activation of liver-type
  phosphofructokinase 1, which thereby controls a key reaction in
  glycolysis. This mechanism is revealed using the mathematical
  model. In this model, the PFKL phosphorylation time courses are
  calculation from the signalling pathway model developed by Kubata
  et al. (2012) (

      <p>Abstract:</p>
      <div class="bibo:abstract">
        <p>Cellular homeostasis is regulated by signals through
    multiple molecular networks that include protein
    phosphorylation and metabolites. However, where and when the
    signal flows through a network and regulates homeostasis has
    not been explored. We have developed a reconstruction method
    for the signal flow based on time-course phosphoproteome and
    metabolome data, using multiple databases, and have applied it
    to acute action of insulin, an important hormone for metabolic
    homeostasis. An insulin signal flows through a network, through
    signaling pathways that involve 13 protein kinases, 26
    phosphorylated metabolic enzymes, and 35 allosteric effectors,
    resulting in quantitative changes in 44 metabolites. Analysis
    of the network reveals that insulin induces phosphorylation and
    activation of liver-type phosphofructokinase 1, thereby
    controlling a key reaction in glycolysis. We thus provide a
    versatile method of reconstruction of signal flow through the
    network using phosphoproteome and metabolome data.</p>
