Abstract
Over the last few decades, there have been significant developments in theoretical, experimental, and clinical approaches to understand the dynamics of cancer cells and their interactions with the immune system. These have led to the development of important methods for cancer therapy including virotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and many others. Along with this, there have also been some developments on analytical and computational models to help provide insights into clinical observations. This work develops a new mathematical model that combines important interactions between tumor cells and cells in the immune systems including natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells combined with drug delivery to these cell sites. These interactions are described via a system of ordinary differential equations that are solved numerically. A stability analysis of this model is also performed to determine conditions for tumor-free equilibrium to be stable. We also study the influence of proliferation rates and drug interventions in the dynamics of all the cells involved. Another contribution is the development of a novel parameter estimation methodology to determine optimal parameters in the model that can reproduce a given dataset. Our results seem to suggest that the model employed is a robust candidate for studying the dynamics of tumor cells and it helps to provide the dynamic interactions between the tumor cells, immune system, and drug-response systems.</pre>
