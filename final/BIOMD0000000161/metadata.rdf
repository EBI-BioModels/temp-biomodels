  <p>The model reproduces the time profiles of Golgi Ras-GTP and plasma membrane Ras-GTP, subjected to a palmitoylation rate of 0.00015849 second inverse. This is depicted in Fig 5a and 5b for various palmitolylation rates, however the value used in this model is not present in the figure in the paper but corresponds to Fig S2 of the supplement. Model successfully reproduced using MathSBML. Please note that the units of volumetric species in this model are molecules/micrometer cubed, to convert this to microMolar as given in the paper, multiply the simulation result by 1/602.</p>
