However, information about intracellular spatial patterns of InsP<sub>3</sub> itself is not generally available. In particular, it has not been determined how the interplay of InsP<sub>3</sub> generation, diffusion, and degradation within complex cellular geometries can control the patterns of InsP<sub>3</sub> signaling. Here, we explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of [InsP<sub>3</sub>]<sub>cyt</sub> during a bradykinin-induced calcium wave in a neuroblastoma cell. This is achieved by using a unique image-based computer modeling system, Virtual Cell, to integrate experimental data on the rates and spatial distributions of the key molecular components of the process. We conclude that the characteristic calcium dynamics requires rapid, high-amplitude production of [InsP<sub>3</sub>]<sub>cyt</sub> in the neurite. This requisite InsP<sub>3</sub> spatiotemporal profile is provided, in turn, as an intrinsic consequence of the cell's morphology, demonstrating how geometry can locally and dramatically intensify cytosolic signals that originate at the plasma membrane. In addition, the model predicts, and experiments confirm, that stimulation of just the neurite, but not the soma or growth cone, is sufficient to generate a calcium response throughout the cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>model</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate</kwd><kwd>fluorescence microscopy</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>I<sc>ntracellular</sc> signaling is composed of complex biochemical pathways that are characterized by robust switching and feedback mechanisms. It has been recognized (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Bray1997">Bray 1997</xref>) that to understand such complex systems, computational approaches will be required. For example, the emergent behavior of interacting pathways in several receptor-mediated cellular responses have been uncovered by solving systems of ordinary differential equations describing the rates of individual biochemical steps (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="BhallaandIyengar1999">Bhalla and Iyengar 1999</xref>). Similarly, the high sensitivity of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade was demonstrated via a numerical analysis of kinetic equations (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="HuangandFerrell1996">Huang and Ferrell 1996</xref>). Arguably, the most frequent application of computational methods has been toward understanding the dynamics of intracellular calcium, where experimentally observed phenomena, such as waves and oscillations, can be rationalized (e.g., <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Atrietal1993">Atri et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lietal1995">Li et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Sneydetal1995">Sneyd et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="KlingaufandNeher1997">Klingauf and Neher 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kupfermanetal1997">Kupferman et al. 1997</xref>). While such studies have provided outstanding insights, they often ignore or use idealized geometries for the treatment of diffusion of signaling molecules within the cell. To deal with diffusion in an irregular cell geometry requires the more computationally intensive and mathematically arduous solution of multiple partial differential equations.</p><p>A primary mechanism for calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Berridge1993">Berridge 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Berridge1998">Berridge 1998</xref>) involves receptor-mediated release of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP<sub>3</sub>) from the inner face of the plasma membrane, followed by its diffusion to a receptor on the ER membrane. This receptor is an InsP<sub>3</sub>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel whose opening permits calcium to flow down its concentration gradient from the ER lumen to the cytosol. The interplay of cell shape, the distribution of relevant receptors, and the spatial organization of the ER within a real cell geometry should impact the pattern of InsP<sub>3</sub>-dependent calcium release. To this end, we have applied a unique computational system for image-based cell biological modeling (Virtual Cell; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Schaffetal1997">Schaff et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Schaffetal1999">Schaff et al. 1999</xref>) to the InsP<sub>3</sub>-mediated calcium dynamics in differentiated N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells with complex neuronal morphologies. The results point to an important role for cellular geometry in controlling the spatial and temporal patterns of intracellular signals.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Calcium Imaging</title><p>N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (obtained from Dr. M. Niremberg, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) were grown and loaded with the calcium indicator fura-2 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Bedlacketal1992">Bedlack et al. 1992</xref>). Images were acquired using a high speed Photometrics CCD camera (frame transfer EEV37 chip) on an inverted Zeiss microscope, controlled by Inovision software on a Silicon Graphics workstation. Cells were bathed in pH-controlled EBSS and maintained at 37&#x000b0;C by means of a plexiglass housing unit built onto the microscope stage. Ratio pairs of 340- and 380-nm excitation were collected for some experiments, with emission passed through a &#x0003e;530-nm filter. Using this acquisition protocol, ratio pairs could be collected approximately once a second. For faster imaging, a single wavelength (380 nm) excitation protocol was used, in which images could be obtained every 65 ms. Relative changes in calcium concentrations were calculated from the fluorescence changes as in <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Finketal1999">Fink et al. 1999</xref>. All image analysis was performed on Silicon Graphics workstations using the programs Ratiotool (Inovision Corp.), used for calcium analysis of dual wavelength experiments, and ISee (Inovision Corp.), on which graphical analysis programs were constructed to do the single wavelength analysis. For quantitative InsP<sub>3</sub> uncaging, we used NPE-InsP<sub>3</sub> and calcium green-1 (CG-1)&#x02013;loaded cells on an inverted NORAN confocal microscope with UV flashes from a xenon arc lamp attached to a computer-controlled shutter.

Cells were loaded with fura-2 and mounted on a specially constructed chamber that provides a steady flow of EBSS buffer solution across the cell. The loaded pipette was directed with a micromanipulator such that the ejected solution was oriented in the flow so that only a chosen segment of the cell (soma, neurite, or distal neurite) was briefly exposed to BK. The ejected puff was visualized by the fluorescence of the coejected fura-2. Ratio images were then collected and calibrated as described.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>When stimulated with a saturating concentration of BK, a nonapeptide neuromodulator, N1E-115 neuroblastomas show a highly reproducible calcium response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> a). After a brief latency (mean &#x000b1; SEM; 2.97 &#x000b1; 0.23 s; <italic>n</italic> = 16), a calcium increase started in the neurite and propagated bidirectionally as a wave towards the soma and growth cone. The wave typically traversed the soma with an average velocity of 39.2 &#x000b1; 3.7 &#x003bc;m/s (<italic>n</italic> = 16), and peak calcium concentrations approximating 1 &#x003bc;M (1190 &#x000b1; 46 nM; <italic>n</italic> = 21). The calcium wave propagated more quickly through the neurite (147.8 &#x000b1; 31.3 &#x003bc;m/s; <italic>n</italic> = 9; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001, compared with wave velocity in the soma) although the amplitude of the calcium response was not significantly different than observed in the soma (1106 &#x000b1; 29 nM; <italic>n</italic> = 17; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> relaxation to basal levels occurred within 30 s of stimulation. Subsequent stimulations with BK did not evoke new calcium signals even after BK washout. This calcium response is known to be mediated by InsP<sub>3</sub> generation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Iredaleetal1992">Iredale et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="CogganandThompson1995">Coggan and Thompson 1995</xref>) and subsequent release of calcium from ER stores. The amplitude of the calcium response is not dependent upon extracellular calcium, indicating that the elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> comes strictly from intracellular stores. In addition, all calcium efflux from the ER is through InsP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive channels, since this cell type lacks ryanodine receptors (calcium-induced calcium release; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="CogganandThompson1995">Coggan and Thompson 1995</xref>).</p><p>To determine the calcium response to an InsP<sub>3</sub> signal with well-controlled spatial and temporal characteristics, caged NPE-InsP<sub>3</sub> was microinjected into the cell (along with CG-1 for calcium imaging) and photoreleased by exposing the entire cell to a brief flash of UV light. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> b, calcium levels increased throughout the cell. However, the levels of calcium increase were substantially higher in the soma than in the neurite. This contrasts sharply with the responses to BK stimulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> a, where the calcium signal has a uniform 1-&#x003bc;M amplitude throughout the cell.</p><p>Further, to determine the dependence of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> signal on [InsP<sub>3</sub>]<sub>cyt</sub> in each region of the cell, we performed quantitative InsP<sub>3</sub> uncaging experiments (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="KhodakhahandOgden1993">Khodakhah and Ogden 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Finketal1999">Fink et al. 1999</xref>), followed by application of BK to the same cells. A dose-response relationship can be observed between calcium release and [InsP<sub>3</sub>]<sub>cyt</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> a), which could be fit with the Hill equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> b; mean Hill coefficient for nine cells, 2.5 &#x000b1; 0.5). This is consistent with other measurements on the [InsP<sub>3</sub>]<sub>cyt</sub> dependence of calcium release (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="OanceaandMeyer1996">Oancea and Meyer 1996</xref>). Subsequent to the uncaging flashes, the BK-evoked calcium response in the soma and neurite was compared with the dose-response. Note that the BK-induced calcium signal in the soma corresponds to uncaged [InsP<sub>3</sub>] of 2.1 &#x000b1; 0.1 &#x003bc;M (<italic>n</italic> = 11 cells). However, BK-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> signals at the initiation point in the neurite could only be matched by uncaging InsP<sub>3</sub> in the range of 5&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M (7.0 &#x000b1; 0.8 &#x003bc;M; mean &#x000b1; SEM; <italic>n</italic> = 9 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> c). This result is consistent with the lower amplitude of the calcium response to a uniform pulse of uncaged InsP<sub>3</sub> in the neurite compared with the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> b), and indicates that the neurite requires three to four times as much InsP<sub>3</sub> as the soma to produce the calcium response evoked by the physiological stimulus of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> a.</p><p>Competitive radioligand binding techniques were employed to approximate the time course of the InsP<sub>3</sub> signal during the BK-stimulated calcium wave for a population of differentiated N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> d). These values have been corrected for cellular volume and the presence of inhibitory factors in the cytosol. The basal level of InsP<sub>3</sub> was determined to be 0.16 &#x003bc;M, rising to a peak concentration of 2 &#x003bc;M within 10 s after stimulation with BK. InsP<sub>3</sub> returned to baseline after an additional 10 s. The amplitude of this InsP<sub>3</sub> signal is consistent with the quantitative uncaging measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> c). The time course of [InsP<sub>3</sub>]<sub>cyt</sub> parallels that of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>, and is indicative of a rapid (half-life &#x0003c;10 s) degradation time for cytosolic InsP<sub>3</sub>, in agreement with previous estimates (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wangetal1995">Wang et al. 1995</xref>).</p><p>To understand how the neurite produces a higher InsP<sub>3</sub> signal than the soma, and why it requires this higher concentration of InsP<sub>3</sub> to set off a calcium wave, we used a computational system for cell biological modeling (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Schaffetal1997">Schaff et al. 1997</xref>) to construct a model based on experimental data for geometrical, electrophysiological, and biochemical components of the system. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> a, the geometric distributions of critical receptors (BK, InsP<sub>3</sub>, and SERCA) are mapped onto a geometry based on the cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> a. This information was compiled through analysis of confocal micrographs of immunofluorescence distribution, using the quantitative procedures developed by <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Finketal1998">Fink et al. 1998</xref>. The other inputs to the model comprised the individual biochemical and electrophysiological processes contributing to the BK-induced calcium wave. These included: flux of InsP<sub>3</sub> into the cytosol from the plasma membrane; rate of InsP<sub>3</sub> degradation; calcium uptake rate of SERCA pumps; [InsP<sub>3</sub>]<sub>cyt</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> binding to the InsP<sub>3</sub>-receptor and the consequent activation and inactivation of calcium efflux from the ER; calcium buffering in the cytosol by mobile and fixed buffers; and diffusion coefficients for InsP<sub>3</sub>, mobile buffers, and calcium.</p><p>The results of the simulation can then be displayed as time-dependent maps of any of the variables. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> b shows the results of the simulation for the response of InsP<sub>3</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> to BK (first four columns). The first two columns represent the results for the average receptor distributions (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> a). The prediction for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> can be directly compared with the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> a. Consistent with experiment, the initial calcium increase is observed in the middle of the neurite after 2.2 s, spreading bidirectionally to the soma and growth cone, and reaching a peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> everywhere of &#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;M. It should be noted that the simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> b were carried out with the average receptor distributions, which clearly would not necessarily pertain to the particular cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> a. Close to an exact match between this individual experiment and the simulation could be achieved if the receptor distributions in the model were permitted to vary within one SD from their means in the parameter space (data not shown). On the other hand, the columns, labeled uniform BKR, show the results of simulations where the BK receptor (BKR) density is set to a uniform distribution along the plasma membrane. The general features of the calcium wave remain unchanged, indicating that the surface receptor distribution is not a critical determining factor.</p><p>Although an elegant indirect method has been described for monitoring intracellular InsP<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hiroseetal1999">Hirose et al. 1999</xref>), there is no available fluorescent indicator for [InsP<sub>3</sub>]. So, the model can provide a unique view of the spatial and temporal distribution of this key metabolite. The calculated [InsP<sub>3</sub>]<sub>cyt</sub> dynamics show a rapid buildup in the neurite to a peak of &#x0223c;10 &#x003bc;M, whereas [InsP<sub>3</sub>]<sub>cyt</sub> in the soma increases more slowly, and to lower peak concentrations (&#x0223c;3 &#x003bc;M). The production of InsP<sub>3</sub> is much faster than its diffusion throughout the intracellular volume and also outpaces the rate of degradation through putative cytosolic kinase and phosphatase based pathways. Therefore, because InsP<sub>3</sub> is produced from the plasma membrane, the cytosolic concentrations of InsP<sub>3</sub> will rise faster and with greater maximum amplitude in the neurite than in the soma. This is primarily because of the high surface to volume ratio of the neurite compared with the soma, with the higher surface density of BKR in the proximal neurite serving only to somewhat focus the site of initiation (compare the second and fourth columns of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> b). When the [InsP<sub>3</sub>] values obtained from our radioligand binding experiments (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) are plotted against the simulated average [InsP<sub>3</sub>] for the entire cell, an excellent match was obtained (displayed in the plot at the bottom of the second column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> b). Of course, because the soma contains the highest proportion of the cell volume, the average [InsP<sub>3</sub>] at any time is only slightly higher than the [InsP<sub>3</sub>] in the soma. Indeed, in addition to providing a picture of the spatiotemporal profile of [InsP<sub>3</sub>] within the cell, our analysis allows us to extract rates for the stimulated flux of InsP<sub>3</sub> from the plasma membrane and degradation in the cytosol from the constraints imposed by the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> d.</p><p>We also modeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> b, last column) uniform InsP<sub>3</sub> uncaging throughout the intracellular volume. In agreement with the experiment (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> b), the simulation shows [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> to be significantly higher in the soma than in the neurite, and no calcium wave behavior is evident. The higher calcium levels in the soma result from its greater density of ER and InsP<sub>3</sub>R as established in our immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> a). This also explains why a higher level of InsP<sub>3</sub> is required in the neurite to produce a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal comparable to that produced in the soma. Thus, the combination of experiment and modeling reveals the interplay of structural features which both produce and require a higher [InsP<sub>3</sub>]<sub>cyt</sub> in the neurite after BK stimulation. Despite the higher amplitude of [InsP<sub>3</sub>]<sub>cyt</sub> in the neurite, the amplitude of the calcium response remains relatively uniform throughout the cell because the calcium stores are biased toward a higher density in the soma.</p><p>To further probe whether this amplified [InsP<sub>3</sub>] in the neurite is necessary and sufficient for initiation and propagation of a calcium wave, we modeled the condition of a local BK stimulation in three distinct cell regions: soma, middle of the neurite, and growth cone (or distal neurite). The results of these simulations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> a. When BK is added to only the soma, elevation of calcium levels occur after a long delay, no wave is generated, and peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> is low (&#x0223c;500 nM). When BK is applied to the neurite, a calcium wave propagates in both directions; whereas [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in the neurite is comparable to that produced by global BK application, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in the soma is lower (&#x0223c;500 nM). Finally, when the application of BK is simulated for only the distal neurite, an immediate calcium increase is seen in that region. However, the wave fails to propagate far up the neurite, and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> soon returns to baseline levels. To check these predictions, we performed a series of experiments in which BK was focally applied by pressure ejection to the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> b). When BK was focally applied to the soma, a gradual increase of calcium was seen in the soma, which failed to propagate down the neurite as a wave (observed in 7/8 cells). When BK is focally applied to only the neurite, a calcium wave is typically initiated (9/13 cells), although [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in the soma didn't reach the levels seen with global BK application. Finally, when BK is focally applied to only the most distal neurite (or growth cone), a local elevation of calcium was observed (7/11 cells), which failed to propagate as a calcium wave to the soma. Together, these experiments validate the predictions made by the simulations, and show that the morphologically enhanced InsP<sub>3</sub> signal in the neurite is necessary and sufficient for initiation and propagation of a calcium wave.</p><p>This study illustrates how an interplay of structural, morphological, and geometric features can play a critical role in defining the spatiotemporal characteristics of intracellular signaling. Such considerations should be of even greater importance for InsP<sub>3</sub>-dependent signaling in primary neurons because of their even greater morphological complexity. For example, it has been previously reported that Purkinje neurons, cells with a particularly extensive dendritic arborization, require very high (&#x0003e;10 &#x003bc;M) concentrations of uncaged InsP<sub>3</sub> to elicit a calcium response (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="KhodakhahandOgden1993">Khodakhah and Ogden 1993</xref>). The very high surface to volume ratio that exists in the dendritic tree may underlie the ability of the Purkinje cell to deliver such high InsP<sub>3</sub> concentrations in response to metabotropic synaptic inputs. Of course, these ideas may be applicable beyond InsP<sub>3</sub>-dependent processes. For example, fine membranous structures, such as lamellipodia and filopodia, play a role in pathfinding and directed motility (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="TheriotandMitchison1992">Theriot and Mitchison 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Davenportetal1993">Davenport et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1996">Zheng et al. 1996</xref>). The intensified signals that are possible in such confined intracellular spaces may represent a common mechanism for such specialized functions. Exploration of these ideas will be facilitated by studies that intimately combine quantitative image-based models with experiment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank B. Ehrlich, M.
