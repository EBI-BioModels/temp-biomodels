  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
          Multisubunit cytokine receptors such as the heterotrimeric receptor for
interleukin-2 (IL-2) are ubiquitous in hematopoeitic cell types of importance in
biotechnology and are crucial regulators of cell proliferation and
differentiation behavior. Dynamics of cytokine/receptor endocytic trafficking
can significantly impact cell responses through effects of receptor
down-regulation and ligand depletion, and in turn are governed by
ligand/receptor binding properties. We describe here a computational model for
trafficking dynamics of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) system, which is able to
predict T cell proliferation responses to IL-2. This model comprises kinetic
equations describing binding, internalization, and postendocytic sorting of IL-2
and IL-2R, including an experimentally derived dependence of cell proliferation
rate on these properties. Computational results from this model predict that
IL-2 depletion can be reduced by decreasing its binding affinity for the IL-2R
betagamma subunit relative to the alpha subunit at endosomal pH, as a result of
enhanced ligand sorting to recycling vis-a-vis degradation, and that an IL-2
analogue with such altered binding properties should exhibit increased potency
for stimulating the T cell proliferation response. These results are in
agreement with our recent experimental findings for the IL-2 analogue termed 2D1
[Fallon, E. M. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 6790-6797]. Thus, this type of
model may enable prediction of beneficial cytokine/receptor binding properties
to aid development of molecular design criteria for improvements in applications
such as in vivo cytokine therapies and in vitro hematopoietic cell bioreactors.      </p>
