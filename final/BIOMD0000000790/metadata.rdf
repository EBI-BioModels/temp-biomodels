  <pre>This is a non-linear mathematical model of cancer immunosurveillance that takes into account intratumoral phenotypic heterogeneity, such as differential expression of cell surface receptors and growth factors, according to cell-mediated immune responses. The model describes phenomena that have also been observed in vivo, such as tumor dormancy, cancer immunoediting, and a strong sensitivity to initial conditions.</pre>
