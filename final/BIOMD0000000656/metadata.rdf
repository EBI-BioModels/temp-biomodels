    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Perturbations in molecular signaling pathways are a result
    of genetic or epigenetic alterations, which may lead to
    malignant transformation of cells. Despite cellular robustness,
    specific genetic or epigenetic changes of any gene can trigger
    a cascade of failures, which result in the malfunctioning of
    cell signaling pathways and lead to cancer phenotypes. The
    extent of cellular robustness has a link with the architecture
    of the network such as feedback and feedforward loops.
    Perturbation in components within feedback loops causes a
    transition from a regulated to a persistently activated state
    and results in uncontrolled cell growth. This work represents
    the mathematical and quantitative modeling of ERK, PI3K/Akt,
    and Wnt/?-catenin signaling crosstalk to show the dynamics of
    signaling responses during genetic and epigenetic changes in
    cancer. ERK, PI3K/Akt, and Wnt/?-catenin signaling crosstalk
    networks include both intra and inter-pathway feedback loops
    which function in a controlled fashion in a healthy cell. Our
    results show that cancerous perturbations of components such as
    EGFR, Ras, B-Raf, PTEN, and components of the destruction
    complex cause extreme fragility in the network and
    constitutively activate inter-pathway positive feedback loops.
    We observed that the aberrant signaling response due to the
    failure of specific network components is transmitted
    throughout the network via crosstalk, generating an additive
    effect on cancer growth and proliferation.</p>
