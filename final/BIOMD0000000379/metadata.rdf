  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
A simulation model of the glucose-insulin system in the postprandial state can be useful in several circumstances, including testing of glucose sensors, insulin infusion algorithms and decision support systems for diabetes. Here, we present a new simulation model in normal humans that describes the physiological events that occur after a meal, by employing the quantitative knowledge that has become available in recent years. Model parameters were set to fit the mean data of a large normal subject database that underwent a triple tracer meal protocol which provided quasi-model-independent estimates of major glucose and insulin fluxes, e.g., meal rate of appearance, endogenous glucose production, utilization of glucose, insulin secretion. By decomposing the system into subsystems, we have developed parametric models of each subsystem by using a forcing function strategy. Model results are shown in describing both a single meal and normal daily life (breakfast, lunch, dinner) in normal. The same strategy is also applied on a smaller database for extending the model to type 2 diabetes
