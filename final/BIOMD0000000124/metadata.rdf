  <p>The model is described in the paper by Wu and Chang (2006). Diethyl pyrocarbonate, a histidine-modifying agent, directly stimulates activity of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pituitary GH3 cells.      <em>Biochem Pharmacol.</em>
          71(5): 615-23.      </p>
  <p>The unit of time is ms, and the simulation time is 80 s, that is 8e4 ms. Therfore, you probably need to increase the maximum steps for your simulator.</p>
  <p>The figure 7 has been reproduced by MathSBML. Application of DEPC as indicated at horizontal bar was mimicked by an increase of maximal conductance of Katp-channels from 500 to 530 ps at t=30 s.</p>
