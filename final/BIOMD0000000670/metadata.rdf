    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Even in the early stages of their development, tumours are
    not simply a homogeneous grouping of mutant cells; rather, they
    develop in tandem with normal tissue cells, and also recruit
    other cell types including lymphatic cells and the endothelial
    cells required for the development of a blood supply. It has
    been repeatedly seen that macrophages form a significant
    proportion of the tumour mass, and that they can have a variety
    of effects upon the tumour, leading to a delicate balance
    between growth promotion and inhibition. This paper develops a
    model for the early, avascular growth of a tumour,
    concentrating on the inhibitory effect of macrophages due to
    their cytolytic activity. It is shown that such an immune
    response is not sufficient to prevent growth, due to it being a
    second-order process with respect to the density of the tumour
    cells present. However, the presence of macrophages does have
    important effects on the tumour composition, and the authors
    perform a detailed bifurcation analysis of their model to
    clarify this. An extended model is also considered which
    incorporates addition of exogenous chemical regulators. In this
    case, the model admits the possibility of tumour regression,
    and the therapeutic implications of this are discussed.</p>
