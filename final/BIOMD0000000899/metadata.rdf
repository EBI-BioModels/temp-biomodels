  <pre>This is a ordinary differential equation mathematical model describing the Rho GTPase cycle in which Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs) inhibit the regulatory activities of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) by interacting with them directly as well as by sequestering the Rho GTPases. The model was constructed with the intent of analyzing the role of RhoGDIs in Rho GTPase signaling.</pre>
