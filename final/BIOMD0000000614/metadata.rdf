  &lt;div class="dc:title"&gt;Kamihira2000 - calcitonin fibrillation kinetics&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="dc:bibliographicCitation"&gt;
    &lt;div class="dc:description"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This model studies the kinetics of human calcitonin fibrillation described as a two-step process. Empirical data is used to determine the parameter values. Results show that the first step in fibrillation is a slow homogenous reaction and the second step is a fast autocatalytic heterogenous reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This model is described in the article:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="bibo:abstract"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Conformational transitions of human calcitonin (hCT) during
    fibril formation in the acidic and neutral conditions were
    investigated by high-resolution solid-state 13C NMR
    spectroscopy. In aqueous acetic acid solution (pH 3.3), a local
    alpha-helical form is present around Gly10 whereas a random
    coil form is dominant as viewed from Phe22, Ala26, and Ala31 in
    the monomer form on the basis of the 13C chemical shifts. On
    the other hand, a local beta-sheet form as viewed from Gly10
    and Phe22, and both beta-sheet and random coil as viewed from
    Ala26 and Ala31 were detected in the fibril at pH 3.3. The
    results indicate that conformational transitions from
    alpha-helix to beta-sheet, and from random coil to beta-sheet
    forms occurred in the central and C-terminus regions,
    respectively, during the fibril formation. The increased 13C
    resonance intensities of fibrils after a certain delay time
    suggests that the fibrillation can be explained by a two-step
    reaction mechanism in which the first step is a homogeneous
    association to form a nucleus, and the second step is an
    autocatalytic heterogeneous fibrillation. In contrast to the
    fibril at pH 3.3, the fibril at pH 7.5 formed a local
    beta-sheet conformation at the central region and exhibited a
    random coil at the C-terminus region. Not only a hydrophobic
    interaction among the amphiphilic alpha-helices, but also an
    electrostatic interaction between charged side chains can play
    an important role for the fibril formation at pH 7.5 and 3.3
    acting as electrostatically favorable and unfavorable
    interactions, respectively. These results suggest that hCT
    fibrils are formed by stacking antiparallel beta-sheets at pH
    7.5 and a mixture of antiparallel and parallel beta-sheets at
    pH 3.3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
