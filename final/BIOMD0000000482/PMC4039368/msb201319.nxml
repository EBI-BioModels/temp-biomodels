Glycolysis is the pathway by which glucose degrades into lactate (LAC), gluconeogenesis is the pathway by which glucose is generated from pyruvate and/or LAC, and glycogenesis is the pathway by which glycogen is synthesised from glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Nordlie et al, 1999</xref>). Glycolysis is regulated by a key bifunctional enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 1 (PFKFB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pilkis et al, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Okar et al, 2001</xref>). Insulin dephosphorylates phosphorylated-PFKFB1 (pPFKFB1) and activates its kinase activity, thereby promoting glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Probst and Unthan-Fechner, 1985</xref>). Although the mechanism by which insulin regulates PFKFB1 remains unclear, the insulin-dependent activation of an unidentified protein phosphatase presumably induces the dephosphorylation of pPFKFB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Pilkis et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Okar et al, 2004</xref>). Gluconeogenesis is regulated by the protein abundance of two major rate-limiting enzymes that are involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Barthel and Schmoll, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Yabaluri and Bashyam, 2010</xref>). Insulin reduces the protein abundance of PEPCK and G6Pase through the AKT-signalling pathway, which leads to the suppression of gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Sutherland et al, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Nakae et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Saltiel and Kahn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Whiteman et al, 2002</xref>). Glycogenesis is regulated by a balance of the enzymatic activities of glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bollen et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Roach et al, 2001</xref>). Insulin promotes glycogenesis by dephosphorylation and activation of GS and/or by dephosphorylation and inactivation of GP via the AKT-signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Srivastava and Pandey, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Whiteman et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aiston et al, 2006</xref>). The GS activity is also allosterically activated by glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) through dephosphorylation of GS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Villar-Palasi and Guinovart, 1997</xref>), and the GP activity is allosterically inhibited by intracellular glucose (GLC<sub>in</sub>) or G6P through dephosphorylation of GP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Johnson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aiston et al, 2003</xref>). In addition, glucokinase (GK) is a rate-limiting enzyme for glucose utilisation in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Ferre et al, 1996</xref>) through glucose phosphorylation. Insulin upregulates the expression of GK via the AKT-signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Iynedjian et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Ribaux and Iynedjian, 2003</xref>) and the activity of GK is also regulated by interaction with its regulatory protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Van Schaftingen et al, 1994</xref>). Many studies have also been done to elucidate hepatic glucose metabolism by use of metabolomic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Soga et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Scribner et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Massimi et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Watanabe et al, 2012</xref>). However, how the above signalling pathways regulate glucose metabolism at system level has thus far not been examined.</p><p>Blood insulin exhibits several temporal patterns, such as additional secretion (which is a transient increase of insulin in response to meals) and basal secretion (which is the sustained low secretion of insulin during fasting) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Polonsky et al, 1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Lindsay et al, 2003</xref>). Such temporal insulin patterns have been reported to have an important physiological role in the regulation of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Polonsky et al, 1988b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">1998</xref>). The relevance of insulin secretion abnormalities in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been recognised as important for the optimisation of the action of insulin on target tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Bruce et al, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Polonsky et al, 1988a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Pratley and Weyer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Del Prato, 2003</xref>). These observations indicate that insulin selectively regulates metabolic processes depending on its temporal pattern. Among the target organs of insulin (liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue), the temporal patterns of insulin particularly affect metabolism in the liver because the temporal patterns of insulin are most evident in the portal vein, which delivers blood from the pancreas to the liver. We have previously found that additional and basal secretion-like temporal patterns of insulin selectively regulate glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; (GSK3&#x003b2;, which in turn regulates glycogenesis) and <italic>G6Pase</italic> (which regulates gluconeogenesis) in FAO rat hepatoma cells through multiplexing of the AKT-signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kubota et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Purvis and Lahav, 2012</xref>). These findings demonstrate that the AKT-signalling pathway can code temporal insulin patterns for the selective regulation of downstream metabolic enzymes. However, the mechanisms by which these temporal insulin patterns selectively regulate glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis have not yet been examined.</p><p>In this study, we measured glucose metabolism in insulin-stimulated FAO rat hepatoma cells, which show a similar signalling response to insulin as that observed in primary hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kubota et al, 2012</xref>). To extract the essential mechanism by which insulin selectively controls glucose metabolism, we used a simple and abstract computational model rather than a detailed biochemical model. We found that glycolysis and glycogenesis respond to temporal insulin changes whereas gluconeogenesis responds to the absolute insulin concentration. In addition, these responses occur through different networks motifs. These results demonstrate the mechanism for the selective control of glucose metabolism by temporal insulin patterns.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Control of insulin-dependent glucose metabolism through the AKT-signalling pathway</title><p>We stimulated FAO cells with an insulin step stimulation, and measured intracellular and extracellular metabolites and proteins that are involved in the glucose metabolism that is controlled through the AKT-signalling pathway in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Nine intracellular metabolites and extracellular pyruvate (PYR<sub>ex</sub>) were measured by capillary electrophoresis coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF-MS). The extracellular glucose concentration (GLC<sub>ex</sub>) and the intracellular glycogen content were also measured by the use of enzymatic assays (see Materials and methods). Insulin induced a gradual decrease of GLC<sub>ex</sub>, which is the final output of glucose metabolism and regulated by a balance between glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). In the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways, insulin induced a transient response in fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F16P), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and induced a sustained increase in intracellular LAC. In contrast, in the glycogenesis pathway, insulin induced a transient response in glucose-1-phosphate (G1P), UDP-glucose (UDPG) and glycogen. We found that there were the two clusters of highly correlated neighbouring metabolites in the glycolysis pathway and glycogenesis pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>, dotted blue box).</p><p>We also measured the phosphorylation of AKT and the glycogenic metabolic enzymes, including GS and GP, as well as the protein abundance of PEPCK and G6Pase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Insulin induced a transient and sustained phosphorylation of AKT, which is consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kubota et al, 2012</xref>). In the gluconeogenesis pathway, insulin induced a gradual and continuous suppression of PEPCK. In the glycogenesis pathway, the phosphorylation of GS was not altered by insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). However, the amount of glycogen increased in response to insulin, which means that the increase of glycogen is not mediated by the phosphorylation of GS at Ser641, which is an important phosphorylation site for the regulation of glycogenesis by insulin via pAKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Skurat and Roach, 1995</xref>), in our system; therefore, an additional mechanism is required to explain this increase in the glycogen. The phosphorylation of GP gradually and continuously increased in response to insulin. We measured G6Pase, which is another rate-limiting enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis, but were not able to determine whether G6Pase decreased in response to insulin because of the large variation obtained between experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, the protein abundance of GK was not changed by insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, an insulin step stimulation induced a variety of temporal patterns in the signalling molecules, enzymes and metabolites, thereby highlighting the complexity of the insulin-induced regulation of glucose metabolism.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Computational model of insulin-dependent glucose metabolism</title><p>We developed a computational model of insulin-dependent glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, see Materials and methods) and examined how insulin regulates glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). We tried to extract the essential and simple characteristics of insulin-dependent glucose metabolism rather than describing detailed metabolic reactions by developing abstract model by aggregating the two clusters of the highly correlated neighbouring metabolites. We aggregated G1P and UDPG into a single variable, &#x02018;G1P', which is a major entry point for glycogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>, dotted blue box). We also aggregated F16P, DHAP, DPG, 3-PG and PEP into a single variable &#x02018;F16P', which has been reported to be directly regulated by insulin through PFKFB1 and is thought to be a key factor in the glycolysis regulation by insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>, dotted blue box). In addition, we aggregated the undetected neighbouring metabolites, GLC<sub>in</sub> and G6P, into a single abstract variable, G6P. For simplification, G6Pase, GS and GK were not incorporated into the model because they were not changed by insulin in FAO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>, see Discussion). Although insulin regulates glucose metabolism, the details of the signalling pathways involved remain unclear. As AKT has been shown to have a major role in insulin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Whiteman et al, 2002</xref>), we assumed that insulin regulates glucose metabolism via AKT. We used our previous computational model for the activation of AKT by insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kubota et al, 2012</xref>) and slightly modified the parameters to fit the experimental data obtained in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1H</xref>, see Materials and methods). We newly constructed the AKT-dependent glucose metabolism model, in which phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) was assumed to suppress PEPCK and facilitate the conversion of G6P to F16P, which in turn activates PFKFB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). GLC<sub>in</sub> or G6P induces the dephosphorylation of GP via the allosteric regulation of phosphorylase phosphatase. We assumed that G6P facilitates the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated GP (pGP). The upstream G1P also exhibited a transient increase similar to that observed with glycogen, which suggests that a metabolic enzyme upstream of G1P is activated by insulin, rather than the metabolic enzyme between G1P and glycogen. We therefore assumed that some metabolite upstream of G1P is regulated by insulin via pAKT. We then connected the AKT-dependent glucose metabolism model to the insulin-dependent AKT pathway model. The connected model is hereafter denoted as the insulin-dependent glucose metabolism model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). We estimated the parameters of the insulin-dependent glucose metabolism model based on the experimental data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3A</xref>. The model appeared to reproduce the essential characteristics of the experimental results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, pAKT exhibited a transient and sustained increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the glycolysis pathway, F16P showed a transient and adaptive response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the glycogenesis pathway, G1P and glycogen also showed both transient and adaptive responses similar to F16P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, in the gluconeogenesis pathway, PEPCK exhibited a gradual and sustained decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). This decrease in PEPCK resulted in the increase of OAA (oxaloacetate) and LAC through the inhibition of the conversion of OAA to F16P and suppressed gluconeogenesis, resulting in decreases of G6P and GLC<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). We next examined the network structures of the pathways by specific deletion of reactions in simulations, and found that the network motif of glycolysis is a feedforward (FF) with substrate depletion, that of gluconeogenesis is a FF and that of glycogenesis is an incoherent feedforward loop (iFFL) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>, see also Figure 6 and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). We also found that GLC<sub>ex</sub> is mainly regulated by gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, but not by glycogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Glucose metabolism in response to a pulse stimulation of insulin</title><p>We next examined how the <italic>in vivo</italic>-like temporal patterns of insulin selectively regulate glucose metabolism. Insulin secretion has two major temporal patterns <italic>in vivo</italic>: additional secretion, which is a rapid transient secretion, and basal secretion, which is a slow sustained secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Polonsky et al, 1988b</xref>). We first experimentally used the additional secretion-like stimulation through a pulse stimulation and examined the responses of pAKT, GLC<sub>ex</sub>, PEPCK and glycogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). In this study, we used F16P, PEPCK and glycogen as markers of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis, respectively. As the availability of CE-TOF-MS was limited and no quantitative enzymatic assay exists for the detection of F16P, we were only able to characterise glycolysis in simulations. We found that pAKT exhibited only a transient response to the pulse stimulation, whereas it exhibited both transient and sustained responses to the step stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>), which is consistent with our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kubota et al, 2012</xref>). In contrast, GLC<sub>ex</sub>, PEPCK and glycogen showed similar responses in response to both the pulse and the step stimulations of insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). As pAKT did not exhibit a sustained response to the pulse stimulation, it can be deduced that GLC<sub>ex</sub>, PEPCK and glycogen do not require a sustained pAKT signal and that a transient pAKT signal is sufficient to suppress gluconeogenesis, lower GLC<sub>ex</sub>, and induce glycogenesis.</p><p>We computationally simulated the responses to the pulse stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>) and reproduced the transient response of pAKT, the sustained responses of GLC<sub>ex</sub> and PEPCK, and the transient response of glycogen. Moreover, GLC<sub>ex</sub>, PEPCK and glycogen showed similar temporal patterns in response to the step and the pulse stimulations. Thus, the model can capture the essential characteristics of the responses to the pulse stimulation, indicating that the model was able to predict the responses to the pulse stimulation. F16P exhibited a transient and adaptive response to both the step and pulse stimulations of insulin.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Glucose metabolism in response to a ramp stimulation of insulin</title><p>We next experimentally used the basal secretion-like stimulation of insulin through a ramp stimulation and examined the responses of pAKT, GLC<sub>ex</sub>, PEPCK and glycogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found that pAKT exhibited only a sustained response to the ramp stimulation, whereas it exhibited both transient and sustained responses to the step stimulation. In contrast, GLC<sub>ex</sub> and PEPCK showed similar sustained responses in response to both the pulse and the step stimulations of insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). As pAKT did not exhibit a transient response to the ramp stimulation, it can be deduced that GLC<sub>ex</sub> and PEPCK do not require a transient pAKT signal and that a sustained pAKT signal is sufficient to suppress gluconeogenesis and lower GLC<sub>ex</sub>. Taken together with the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>, either transient or sustained pAKT signal alone is sufficient to trigger the sustained suppressions of gluconeogenesis and GLC<sub>ex</sub>. Moreover, considering that GLC<sub>ex</sub> and PEPCK always show a similar sustained response, PEPCK is likely to mainly contribute to the regulation of GLC<sub>ex</sub> by insulin. In contrast, glycogen did not respond to the ramp stimulation of insulin in spite of the transient response to the step stimulation. Given that pulse and ramp stimulation resemble the additional and basal secretion of insulin <italic>in vivo</italic>, respectively, these results demonstrate that GLC<sub>ex</sub> and gluconeogenesis can respond to both additional and basal secretion of insulin, whereas glycogenesis selectively responds to additional secretion of insulin.</p><p>We computationally predicted the responses to the ramp stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>) and reproduced the sustained response of pAKT, the sustained responses of GLC<sub>ex</sub> and PEPCK, and no response of glycogen. Moreover, GLC<sub>ex</sub> and PEPCK showed similar sustained patterns in response to the step and the ramp stimulations. Thus, the model can capture the essential characteristics of the responses to the ramp stimulation, indicating that the model was able to predict the responses to the ramp stimulation. F16P did not respond to the ramp stimulations of insulin in the model, suggesting that glycolysis selectively responds to additional secretion of insulin.</p><p>We then computationally examined the sensitivity of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis to the rate of insulin increase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), and confirmed that transient responses of pAKT, glycogen and F16P were sensitive to the rate of insulin increase, whereas sustained responses of pAKT, GLC<sub>ex</sub> and PEPCK were insensitive to that.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that glycolysis and glycogenesis respond to temporal changes of insulin concentration, whereas gluconeogenesis and GLC<sub>ex</sub> respond to the absolute insulin concentration but not to its temporal changes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sensitivity of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis to the concentration of insulin</title><p>We next examined the sensitivity of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis to the concentration of insulin using step stimulations with different concentrations of insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). We graphed the amplitude of the molecules at the transient peak and at the final time point in the simulation, the latter of which is a marker for the sustained phase, against the insulin concentration used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>, solid lines), and then we experimentally validated the simulated results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>, dots). pAKT at the transient peak and at final time point gradually increased against the insulin concentration, indicating that pAKT can code information over a wide dynamic range of insulin concentrations in both transient and sustained phases. Glycogen and F16P at the transient peak increased gradually against insulin concentration, indicating that insulin can regulate glycogenesis and glycolysis over a wide dynamic range. In contrast, glycogen and F16P at the final time point showed a flat curve against the insulin concentration, indicating that glycogen and F16P exhibit adaptation. PEPCK and GLC<sub>ex</sub> exhibited an abrupt decrease against insulin concentration. PEPCK and GLC<sub>ex</sub> at the early time point showed a flat curve against insulin concentration. The EC<sub>50</sub>s of insulin, which give 50&#x00025; of the maximal responses, were 0.013&#x02009;nM for PEPCK, 0.085&#x02009;nM for GLC<sub>ex</sub>, 0.55&#x02009;nM for F16P and 0.79&#x02009;nM for glycogen in the simulation. This result indicates that PEPCK and GLC<sub>ex</sub> show higher sensitivity to insulin than F16P and glycogen. The similar high sensitivity of both PEPCK and GLC<sub>ex</sub> suggests that GLC<sub>ex</sub> is mainly regulated by PEPCK at low doses of insulin. In summary, step stimulation of insulin induced the transient and sustained response of pAKT, the transient and adaptive responses of F16P and glycogen, and the sustained responses of PEPCK and GLC<sub>ex</sub>. The transient responses of pAKT, F16P and glycogen showed low sensitivity to insulin, whereas the sustained responses of PEPCK and GLC<sub>ex</sub> showed high sensitivity to insulin.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mechanism of the insulin-dependent regulation of glucose metabolism in the model are summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. F16P is regulated through a FF activation by the pAKT-dependent conversion of G6P to F16P and the substrate depletion of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>, orange), which makes glycolysis responsive to temporal changes in the concentration of insulin rather than its absolute concentration. The pAKT-dependent suppression of PEPCK indicates FF inhibition with the small EC<sub>50</sub> and large time constant, which makes gluconeogenesis responsive to absolute concentration of insulin regardless of its temporal patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>, pink). The 3-node network of pAKT, PEPCK and F16P also forms an Incoherent Type 4 motif with substrate depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Mangan and Alon, 2003</xref>). Glycogen is regulated by an iFFL that consists of activation via the pAKT-dependent production of G1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>, cyan) and inhibition via the G6P-dependent inhibition of pGP, which makes glycogenesis responsive to temporal changes of insulin rather than its absolute concentration. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>, cyan). The network motif of glycogen regulation by insulin via pAKT also forms an Incoherent Type 1 motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Mangan and Alon, 2003</xref>), that have been known to show an adaptive response and responsiveness to the fold change of the input signal rather than the absolute levels of the input signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Goentoro et al, 2009</xref>). GLC<sub>ex</sub> is regulated by gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, which makes GLC<sub>ex</sub> responsive to all of the stimulation patterns of insulin, such as step, pulse and ramp stimulation. In conclusion, temporal patterns of insulin selectively regulate glucose metabolism through the distinct network motifs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Step stimulation of insulin induces the transient and adaptive responses of glycolysis via F16P through a FF with substrate depletion, the transient and adaptive responses of gluconeogenesis via PEPCK through a FF inhibition and the sustained response of glycogenesis through an incoherent FF loop (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Pulse stimulation of insulin induces responses of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis. Ramp stimulation of insulin induces only the response of gluconeogenesis (via PEPCK), but not those of glycolysis (via F16P) and glycogenesis. Glycolysis and glycogenesis showed the similar responsiveness to step, pulse and ramp stimulation of insulin despite their different network motifs. In this study, we assumed that pAKT controls glucose metabolism based on the fact that pAKT show the essential role in hepatic glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Saltiel and Kahn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Whiteman et al, 2002</xref>). However, it remains to be clarified whether pAKT directly controls glucose metabolism, and further study is necessary to identify detailed molecular mechanism of glucose metabolism.</p><p>Considering that the additional and basal secretions of insulin correspond to the pulse and ramp stimulations used in this study, respectively, glycolysis and glycogenesis selectively respond to additional secretion and gluconeogenesis responds to both additional and basal secretions. This finding suggests that glycolysis and glycogenesis might be induced selectively during the postprandial elevation of blood glucose concentrations through the additional secretion of insulin and might be adapted when the blood glucose concentration returns to its basal level. This suggests that glycogenesis may be induced immediately after meals, when the blood glucose concentration is high, and may be tightly and precisely controlled over a wide range of insulin concentrations. Glycogenesis did not contribute to the regulation of GLC<sub>ex</sub>, likely because of the experimental conditions used in our study. We used glucose starvation to observe the changes in the GLC<sub>ex</sub> (see Materials and methods), which may lead to an extreme decrease in glycogen at the basal level. Therefore, the contribution of glycogenesis to extracellular glucose regulation may be underestimated.</p><p>Gluconeogenesis was more sensitive to the concentration of insulin. This result suggests that gluconeogenesis may be induced only when blood glucose and insulin concentrations are low for long periods, such as during fasting and overnight, and is tightly inhibited by the additional secretion that occurs when insulin is triggered by high postprandial glucose concentrations. This conclusion is consistent with our previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kubota et al, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The inhibition of hepatic glucose release by insulin <italic>in vivo</italic> has been reported to be more rapid (&#x0223c;15&#x02009;min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sindelar et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Grubert et al, 2005</xref>). However, the decrease in GLC<sub>ex</sub> exhibited a slower response with a time constant of &#x0223c;1&#x02009;h. The regulation of gene and protein expression levels generally has a time constant on the order of hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Papin et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Alon, 2007</xref>). In fact, we confirmed that the protein expression of PEPCK in the rat liver in response to the addition of oral glucose did not change over at least 2&#x02009;h. Thus, the rapid inhibition of hepatic glucose release <italic>in vivo</italic> is probably regulated by a different rapid regulation mechanism, such as the post-translational modification of enzymes in the glycolysis pathway.</p><p>Both <italic>G6Pase</italic> and PEPCK are the rate-limiting enzymes for gluconeogenesis, and share the feedfoward motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kubota et al, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). However, <italic>G6Pase</italic> cannot sufficiently respond to an insulin pulse stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kubota et al, 2012</xref>), whereas PEPCK can (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). The reason why only PEPCK can respond to an insulin pulse stimulation is its smaller EC<sub>50</sub> and the larger apparent time constant compared with those of <italic>G6Pase</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>); increasing the EC<sub>50</sub> of PEPCK or decreasing the apparent time constant of PEPCK made PEPCK unresponsive to an insulin pulse stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, we previously found that GSK3&#x003b2;, which is a signalling molecule for glycogenesis, shows a transient and sustained response to an insulin step stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kubota et al, 2012</xref>); whereas in this study, we found that the phosphorylation of GS at Ser641, which is the direct downstream molecule of GSK3&#x003b2;, is not changed by insulin stimulation. This suggests that GSK3&#x003b2; may not be involved in glycogenesis under the conditions used in FAO cells.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that temporal insulin patterns selectively regulate gluconeogenesis, glycogenesis and glycolysis via the AKT-signalling pathway in FAO hepatoma cells. Although we previously confirmed that FAO cells show a similar signalling response to insulin as that observed in primary hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kubota et al, 2012</xref>), some metabolic responses may be different between FAO cells and primary hepatocytes. For example, GK was not incorporated into the current model, because the protein abundance of GK was not changed by insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) and the activity of GK in FAO cells has been reported to be much lower than that in primary hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Argaud et al, 1997</xref>); however, GK is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme for glucose utilisation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Ferre et al, 1996</xref>), and therefore, the effect of GK should be incorporated into the <italic>in vivo</italic> model. In addition, GS, which is considered to be responsible for glycogen synthesis <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Skurat and Roach, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Villar-Palasi and Guinovart, 1997</xref>), was also not incorporated into the current model because the important phosphorylation site of GS (Ser641) for glycogenesis regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Skurat and Roach, 1995</xref>) was not changed by insulin. Further study is necessary to address whether the temporal insulin patterns are used to selectively regulate hepatic glucose metabolism <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>For the assays, FAO cells were seeded at a density of 3.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells in 6-cm dishes (Corning) and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10&#x00025; (v/v) fetal bovine serum for 2 days before starvation.

We newly developed the AKT-dependent glucose metabolism model based on Michaelis&#x02013;Menten kinetics for the metabolic reactions. We used mass action kinetics for the G6P-induced phosphorylation of GP and the pAKT-induced gene expression of PEPCK. We also used the previously developed insulin-dependent pAKT pathway model for the upstream pAKT-signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kubota et al, 2012</xref>). The parameters of the AKT-dependent glucose metabolism model were estimated using the experimental data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3A</xref> according to two methods-in-series: a meta-evolutionary programming method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Fogel et al, 1991</xref>) was used to approach the neighbourhood of the local minimum, and the Nelder&#x02013;Mead method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Nelder and Mead, 1965</xref>) was used to reach the local minimum. Using these methods, the parameters were estimated to minimise the value of the objective function, which was defined as the sum of the squared residuals between our measurements and the model trajectories. After 200 independent estimations of the model, we selected the model and parameters that resulted in the minimum value for the objective function. The parameters and equations used in this study are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>. We also modified the parameters of the insulin-dependent pAKT pathway model because we obtained the data at higher insulin doses (0&#x02013;100&#x02009;nM of insulin) in the current study than those (0&#x02013;1&#x02009;nM of insulin) in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kubota et al, 2012</xref>).

As our aim is to explore how specific temporal patterns of insulin are selectively decoded by temporal patterns of the metabolites, we compared the experimental data of the actual molecules with the simulated data of the corresponding abstract variables in the model in terms of temporal patterns. Therefore, the absolute concentration of the molecules cannot be directly compared between the experimental and simulated data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d33e26" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplementary Information</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201319-s1.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d33e29" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Insulin-dependent Glucose Metabolism Model</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201319-s2.xml"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d33e32" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Review Process File</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb201319-s3.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We deeply thank Kasumi Kashikura (of the Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University) for providing excellent technical support during the CE-TOF-MS analysis.
