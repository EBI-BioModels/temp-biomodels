    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) exists in
    two multiprotein complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) and is a central
    regulator of growth and metabolism. Insulin activation of
    mTORC1, mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and
    the inhibitory tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1-TSC2),
    initiates a negative feedback loop that ultimately inhibits
    PI3K. We present a data-driven dynamic insulin-mTOR network
    model that integrates the entire core network and used this
    model to investigate the less well understood mechanisms by
    which insulin regulates mTORC2. By analyzing the effects of
    perturbations targeting several levels within the network in
    silico and experimentally, we found that, in contrast to
    current hypotheses, the TSC1-TSC2 complex was not a direct or
    indirect (acting through the negative feedback loop) regulator
    of mTORC2. Although mTORC2 activation required active PI3K,
    this was not affected by the negative feedback loop. Therefore,
    we propose an mTORC2 activation pathway through a PI3K variant
    that is insensitive to the negative feedback loop that
    regulates mTORC1. This putative pathway predicts that mTORC2
    would be refractory to Akt, which inhibits TSC1-TSC2, and,
    indeed, we found that mTORC2 was insensitive to constitutive
    Akt activation in several cell types. Our results suggest that
    a previously unknown network structure connects mTORC2 to its
    upstream cues and clarifies which molecular connectors
    contribute to mTORC2 activation.</p>
