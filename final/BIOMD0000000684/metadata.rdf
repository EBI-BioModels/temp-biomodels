  <strong>Evolution of immunological memory and the regulation of competition between

  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
          Memory is a central characteristic of immune responses. It is defined as an
elevated number of specific immune cells that remain after resolution of
infection and can protect the host against reinfection. The evolution of
immunological memory is subject to debate. The advantages of memory discussed so
far include protection from reinfection, control of chronic infection, and the
transfer of immune function to the next generation. Mathematical models are used
to identify a new force that can drive the evolution of immunological memory:
the duration of memory can regulate the degree of competition between different
pathogens. While a long duration of memory provides lasting protection against
reinfection, it may also allow an inferior pathogen species to persist. This can
be detrimental for the host if the inferior pathogen is more virulent. On the
other hand, a shorter duration of memory ensures that an inferior pathogen
species is excluded. This can be beneficial for the host if the inferior
pathogen is more virulent. Thus, while in the absence of pathogen diversity
memory is always expected to evolve to a long duration, under specific
circumstances, memory can evolve toward shorter durations in the presence of
pathogen diversity.      </p>
