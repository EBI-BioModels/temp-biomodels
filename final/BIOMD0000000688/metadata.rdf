  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
          Upon acute viral infection, a typical cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response is
characterized by a phase of expansion and contraction after which it settles at
a relatively stable memory level. Recently, experimental data from mice infected
with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) showed different and unusual dynamics. After
acute infection had resolved, some antigen specific CTL started to expand over
time despite the fact that no replicative virus was detectable. This phenomenon
has been termed as &quot;CTL memory inflation&quot;. In order to examine the dynamics of
this system further, we developed a mathematical model analysing the impact of
innate and adaptive immune responses. According to this model, a potentially
important contributor to CTL inflation is competition between the specific CTL
response and an innate natural killer (NK) cell response. Inflation occurs most
readily if the NK cell response is more efficient than the CTL at reducing virus
load during acute infection, but thereafter maintains a chronic virus load which
is sufficient to induce CTL proliferation. The model further suggests that
weaker NK cell mediated protection can correlate with more pronounced CTL
inflation dynamics over time. We present experimental data from mice infected
with MCMV which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. This model
provides valuable information and may help to explain the inflation of CMV
specific CD8+T cells seen in humans as they age.      </p>
