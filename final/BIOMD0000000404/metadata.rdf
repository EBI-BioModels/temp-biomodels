    dc:description """<body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>This version of the model is very close to the version described in the paper with one exception: the binding of aspartate to the various receptor complexes, as well as the formation of the different complexes are modeled using chemical kinetics (mass action law), rather than instant equilibrium. The qualitative behaviour of the model is unchanged. Note that in order to quantitatively replicate the figure 8b, and in particular to have a basal bias of 0.7, we have to change the rate constant of the aspartate-triggered dephosphorylation of CheY from 59000 to 70000. The peaks have then slightly different values.</p>
