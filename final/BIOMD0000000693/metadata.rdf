    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Riluzole is known to be of therapeutic use in the management
    of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this study, we
    investigated the effects of riluzole on ion currents in
    cultured differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (dHSkMCs).
    Western blotting revealed the protein expression of
    alpha-subunits for both large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+
    (BK(Ca)) channel and Na+ channel (Na(v)1.5) in these cells.
    Riluzole could reduce the frequency of spontaneous beating in
    dHSkMCs. In whole-cell configuration, riluzole suppressed
    voltage-gated Na+ current (I(Na)) in a concentration-dependent
    manner with an IC50 value of 2.3 microM. Riluzole (10 microM)
    also effectively increased Ca2+-activated K+ current (I(K(Ca)))
    which could be reversed by iberiotoxin (200 nM) and paxilline
    (1 microM), but not by apamin (200 nM). In inside-out patches,
    when applied to the inside of the cell membrane, riluzole (10
    microM) increased BK(Ca)-channel activity with a decrease in
    mean closed time. Simulation studies also unraveled that both
    decreased conductance of I(Na) and increased conductance of
    I(K(Ca)) utilized to mimic riluzole actions in skeletal muscle
    cells could combine to decrease the amplitude of action
    potentials and increase the repolarization of action
    potentials. Taken together, inhibition of I(Na) and stimulation
    of BK(Ca)-channel activity caused by this drug are partly, if
    not entirely, responsible for its muscle relaxant actions in
    clinical setting.</p>
