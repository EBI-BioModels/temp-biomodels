    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>After DNA damage, the cell cycle is arrested to avoid
    propagation of mutations. Arrest in G2 phase is initiated by
    ATM-/ATR-dependent signaling that inhibits mitosis-promoting
    kinases such as Plk1. At the same time, Plk1 can counteract
    ATR-dependent signaling and is required for eventual resumption
    of the cell cycle. However, what determines when Plk1 activity
    can resume remains unclear. Here, we use FRET-based reporters
    to show that a global spread of ATM activity on chromatin and
    phosphorylation of ATM targets including KAP1 control Plk1
    re-activation. These phosphorylations are rapidly counteracted
    by the chromatin-bound phosphatase Wip1, allowing cell cycle
    restart despite persistent ATM activity present at DNA lesions.
    Combining experimental data and mathematical modeling, we
    propose a model for how the minimal duration of cell cycle
    arrest is controlled. Our model shows how cell cycle restart
    can occur before completion of DNA repair and suggests a
    mechanism for checkpoint adaptation in human cells.</p>
