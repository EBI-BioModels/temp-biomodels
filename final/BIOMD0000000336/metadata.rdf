    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>A mathematical simulation of the tissue factor pathway to
    the generation of thrombin has been developed using a
    combination of empirical, estimated, and deduced rate constants
    for reactions involving the activation of factor IX, X, V, and
    VIII, in the formation of thrombin, as well as rate constants
    for the assembly of the coagulation enzyme complexes which
    involve factor VIIIa-factor IXa (intrinsic tenase) and factor
    Va-Xa (prothrombinase) assembled on phospholipid membrane.
    Differential equations describing the fate of each species in
    the reaction were developed and solved using an interactive
    procedure based upon the Runge-Kutta technique. In addition to
    the theoretical considerations involving the reactions of the
    tissue factor pathway, a physical constraint associated with
    the stability of the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex has been
    incorporated into the model based upon the empirical
    observations associated with the stability of this complex. The
    model system provides a realistic accounting of the fates of
    each of the proteins in the coagulation reaction through a
    range of initiator (factor VIIa-tissue factor) concentrations
    ranging from 5 pM to 5 nM. The model is responsive to
    alterations in the concentrations of factor VIII, factor V, and
    their respective activated species, factor VIIIa and factor Va,
    and overall provides a reasonable approximation of empirical
    data. The computer model permits the assessment of the reaction
    over a broad range of conditions and provides a useful tool for
    the development and management of reaction studies.</p>
