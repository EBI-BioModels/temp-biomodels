          Abstract:      <br/>
          An important question in plant biology is how genes influence the crosstalk between hormones to regulate growth. In this study, we model POLARIS (PLS) gene function and crosstalk between auxin, ethylene and cytokinin in Arabidopsis. Experimental evidence suggests that PLS acts on or close to the ethylene receptor ETR1, and a mathematical model describing possible PLS-ethylene pathway interactions is developed, and used to make quantitative predictions about PLS-hormone interactions. Modelling correctly predicts experimental results for the effect of the pls gene mutation on endogenous cytokinin concentration. Modelling also reveals a role for PLS in auxin biosynthesis in addition to a role in auxin transport. The model reproduces available mutants, and with new experimental data provides new insights into how PLS regulates auxin concentration, by controlling the relative contribution of auxin transport and biosynthesis and by integrating auxin, ethylene and cytokinin signalling. Modelling further reveals that a bell-shaped dose-response relationship between endogenous auxin and root length is established via PLS. This combined modelling and experimental analysis provides new insights into the integration of hormonal signals in plants.      </p>
  <p>This model was originally created using Copasi and taken from the supplementary materials of the MSB article. It uses equation 5 for the auxin biosynthesis and was altered to also contain the reactions for ACC, IAA and cytokinine import. Different from the supplementary material, the parameters for the auxin synthesis, v2, are set to k2c = 0.01 uM and k2=0.2 uM_per_sec and for the WT PLS transcription k6=0.3 . To obtain the model described in the first table of the supplementary materials, set k2c=k2=0 and k6=0.9 . For the pls and PLSox mutants, k6 should be set to 0 and 0.45, respectively.</p>
