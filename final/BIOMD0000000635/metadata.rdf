    &lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="bibo:abstract"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Transient changes in striatal dopamine (DA) concentration
    are considered to encode a reward prediction error (RPE) in
    reinforcement learning tasks. Often, a phasic DA change occurs
    concomitantly with a dip in striatal acetylcholine (ACh),
    whereas other neuromodulators, such as adenosine (Adn), change
    slowly. There are abundant adenylyl cyclase (AC) coupled GPCRs
    for these neuromodulators in striatal medium spiny neurons
    (MSNs), which play important roles in plasticity. However,
    little is known about the interaction between these
    neuromodulators via GPCRs. The interaction between these
    transient neuromodulator changes and the effect on cAMP/PKA
    signaling via Golf- and Gi/o-coupled GPCR are studied here
    using quantitative kinetic modeling. The simulations suggest
    that, under basal conditions, cAMP/PKA signaling could be
    significantly inhibited in D1R+ MSNs via ACh/M4R/Gi/o and an
    ACh dip is required to gate a subset of D1R/Golf-dependent PKA
    activation. Furthermore, the interaction between ACh dip and DA
    peak, via D1R and M4R, is synergistic. In a similar fashion,
    PKA signaling in D2+ MSNs is under basal inhibition via
    D2R/Gi/o and a DA dip leads to a PKA increase by disinhibiting
    A2aR/Golf, but D2+ MSNs could also respond to the DA peak via
    other intracellular pathways. This study highlights the
    similarity between the two types of MSNs in terms of high basal
    AC inhibition by Gi/o and the importance of interactions
    between Gi/o and Golf signaling, but at the same time predicts
    differences between them with regard to the sign of RPE
    responsible for PKA activation.Dopamine transients are
    considered to carry reward-related signal in reinforcement
    learning. An increase in dopamine concentration is associated
    with an unexpected reward or salient stimuli, whereas a
    decrease is produced by omission of an expected reward. Often
    dopamine transients are accompanied by other neuromodulatory
    signals, such as acetylcholine and adenosine. We highlight the
    importance of interaction between acetylcholine, dopamine, and
    adenosine signals via adenylyl-cyclase coupled GPCRs in shaping
    the dopamine-dependent cAMP/PKA signaling in striatal neurons.
    Specifically, a dopamine peak and an acetylcholine dip must
    interact, via D1 and M4 receptor, and a dopamine dip must
    interact with adenosine tone, via D2 and A2a receptor, in
    direct and indirect pathway neurons, respectively, to have any
    significant downstream PKA activation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
