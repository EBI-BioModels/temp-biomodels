    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The aggregation of proteins is believed to be intimately
    connected to many neurodegenerative disorders. We recently
    reported an &quot;Ockham&apos;s razor&quot;/minimalistic approach to analyze
    the kinetic data of protein aggregation using the Finke-Watzky
    (F-W) 2-step model of nucleation (A--&gt;B, rate constant k(1))
    and autocatalytic growth (A+B--&gt;2B, rate constant k(2)).
    With that kinetic model we have analyzed 41 representative
    protein aggregation data sets in two recent publications,
    including amyloid beta, alpha-synuclein, polyglutamine, and
    prion proteins (Morris, A. M., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47,
    2413-2427; Watzky, M. A., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47,
    10790-10800). Herein we use the F-W model to reanalyze protein
    aggregation kinetic data obtained under the experimental
    conditions of variable temperature or pH 2.0 to 8.5. We provide
    the average nucleation (k(1)) and growth (k(2)) rate constants
    and correlations with variable temperature or varying pH for
    the protein alpha-synuclein. From the variable temperature
    data, activation parameters DeltaG(double dagger),
    DeltaH(double dagger), and DeltaS(double dagger) are provided
    for nucleation and growth, and those values are compared to the
    available parameters reported in the previous literature
    determined using an empirical method. Our activation parameters
    suggest that nucleation and growth are energetically similar
    for alpha-synuclein aggregation (DeltaG(double
    dagger)(nucleation)=23(3) kcal/mol; DeltaG(double
    dagger)(growth)=22(1) kcal/mol at 37 degrees C). From the
    variable pH data, the F-W analyses show a maximal k(1) value at
    pH approximately 3, as well as minimal k(1) near the
    isoelectric point (pI) of alpha-synuclein. Since solubility and
    net charge are minimized at the pI, either or both of these
    factors may be important in determining the kinetics of the
    nucleation step. On the other hand, the k(2) values increase
    with decreasing pH (i.e., do not appear to have a minimum or
    maximum near the pI) which, when combined with the k(1) vs. pH
    (and pI) data, suggest that solubility and charge are less
    important factors for growth, and that charge is important in
    the k(1), nucleation step of alpha-synuclein. The chemically
    well-defined nucleation (k(1)) rate constants obtained from the
    F-W analysis are, as expected, different than the 1/lag-time
    empirical constants previously obtained. However, k(2)x[A](0)
    (where k(2) is the rate constant for autocatalytic growth and
    [A](0) is the initial protein concentration) is related to the
    empirical constant, k(app) obtained previously. Overall, the
    average nucleation and average growth rate constants for
    alpha-synuclein aggregation as a function of pH and variable
    temperature have been quantitated. Those values support the
    previously suggested formation of a partially folded
    intermediate that promotes aggregation under high temperature
    or acidic conditions.</p>
