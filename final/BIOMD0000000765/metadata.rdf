  <pre>This model was developed with the aim of constructing an equilibrium model of the pharmacokinetic behaviour of a drug exhibiting target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD). TMDD involves the inclusion of drug-target interactions within a pharmacokinetic description, something which is usually considered negligible and subsequently excluded. Two approaches were used, one of which involved a quasi-equilibrium method to describe the kinetics of TMDD.</pre>
