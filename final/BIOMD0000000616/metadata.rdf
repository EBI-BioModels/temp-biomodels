  &lt;div class="dc:description"&gt;This is a sub-model of a three-step
inflammatory response modelling study. The model includes distinct
populations of white blood cells namely, macrophages and active and
apoptotic neutrophil populations. Neutrophil apoptosis rate is
predicted to be crucial for the qualitative nature of the
system.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="dc:bibliographicCitation"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="bibo:abstract"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is growing interest in inflammation due to its
    involvement in many diverse medical conditions, including
    Alzheimer&amp;apos;s disease, cancer, arthritis and asthma. The
    traditional view that resolution of inflammation is a passive
    process is now being superceded by an alternative hypothesis
    whereby its resolution is an active, anti-inflammatory process
    that can be manipulated therapeutically. This shift in mindset
    has stimulated a resurgence of interest in the biological
    mechanisms by which inflammation resolves. The
    anti-inflammatory processes central to the resolution of
    inflammation revolve around macrophages and are closely related
    to pro-inflammatory processes mediated by neutrophils and their
    ability to damage healthy tissue. We develop a spatially
    averaged model of inflammation centring on its resolution,
    accounting for populations of neutrophils and macrophages and
    incorporating both pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. Our
    ordinary differential equation model exhibits two outcomes that
    we relate to healthy and unhealthy states. We use bifurcation
    analysis to investigate how variation in the system parameters
    affects its outcome. We find that therapeutic manipulation of
    the rate of macrophage phagocytosis can aid in resolving
    inflammation but success is critically dependent on the rate of
    neutrophil apoptosis. Indeed our model predicts that an
    effective treatment protocol would take a dual approach,
    targeting macrophage phagocytosis alongside neutrophil
    apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
