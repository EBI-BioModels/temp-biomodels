    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Liver regeneration is a tightly controlled process mainly
    achieved by proliferation of usually quiescent hepatocytes. The
    specific molecular mechanisms ensuring cell division only in
    response to proliferative signals such as hepatocyte growth
    factor (HGF) are not fully understood. Here, we combined
    quantitative time-resolved analysis of primary mouse hepatocyte
    proliferation at the single cell and at the population level
    with mathematical modeling. We showed that numerous G1/S
    transition components are activated upon hepatocyte isolation
    whereas DNA replication only occurs upon additional HGF
    stimulation. In response to HGF, Cyclin:CDK complex formation
    was increased, p21 rather than p27 was regulated, and Rb
    expression was enhanced. Quantification of protein levels at
    the restriction point showed an excess of CDK2 over CDK4 and
    limiting amounts of the transcription factor E2F-1. Analysis
    with our mathematical model revealed that T160 phosphorylation
    of CDK2 correlated best with growth factor-dependent
    proliferation, which we validated experimentally on both the
    population and the single cell level. In conclusion, we
    identified CDK2 phosphorylation as a gate-keeping mechanism to
    maintain hepatocyte quiescence in the absence of HGF.</p>
