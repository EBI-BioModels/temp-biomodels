Abstract: 

The goal of palliative cancer chemotherapy treatment is to prolong survival and improve quality of life when tumour eradication is not feasible. Chemotherapy protocol design is considered in this context using a simple, robust, model of advanced tumour growth with Gompertzian dynamics, taking into account the effects of drug resistance. It is predicted that reduced chemotherapy protocols can readily lead to improved survival times due to the effects of competition between resistant and sensitive tumour cells. Very early palliation is also predicted to quickly yield near total tumour resistance and thus decrease survival duration. Finally, our simulations indicate that failed curative attempts using dose densification, a common protocol escalation strategy, can reduce survival times.
