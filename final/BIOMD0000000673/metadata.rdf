      <p>OBJECTIVE: Clinical trial simulation (CTS) was used to
    select a robust design to test the hypothesis that a new
    treatment was effective for Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD).
    Typically, a parallel group, placebo controlled, 12-week trial
    in 200-400 AD patients would be used to establish drug effect
    relative to placebo (i.e., Ho: Drug Effect = 0). We evaluated
    if a crossover design would allow smaller and shorter duration
    trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A family of plausible drug and
    disease models describing the time course of the AD assessment
    scale (ADAS-Cog) was developed based on Phase I data and
    literature reports of other treatments for AD. The models
    included pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, disease progression,
    and placebo components. Eight alternative trial designs were
    explored via simulation. One hundred replicates of each
    combination of drug and disease model and trial design were
    simulated. A &apos;positive trial&apos; reflecting drug activity was
    declared considering both a dose trend test (p &lt; 0.05) and
    pair-wise comparisons to placebo (p &lt; 0.025). RESULTS: A 4 x
    4 Latin Square design was predicted to have at least 80% power
    to detect activity across a range of drug and disease models.
    The trial design was subsequently implemented and the trial was
    completed. Based on the results of the actual trial, a
    conclusive decision about further development was taken. The
    crossover design provided enhanced power over a parallel group
    design due to the lower residual variability. CONCLUSION: CTS
    aided the decision to use a more efficient proof of concept
    trial design, leading to savings of up to US 4 M dollars in
    direct costs and a firm decision 8-12 months earlier than a
    12-week parallel group trial.</p>
