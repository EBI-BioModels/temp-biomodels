    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are transmembrane
    oligomeric proteins that mediate interconversions between open
    and closed channel states under the control of
    neurotransmitters. Fast in vitro chemical kinetics and in vivo
    electrophysiological recordings are consistent with the
    following multi-step scheme. Upon binding of agonists, receptor
    molecules in the closed but activatable resting state (the
    Basal state, B) undergo rapid transitions to states of higher
    affinities with either open channels (the Active state, A) or
    closed channels (the initial Inactivatable and fully
    Desensitized states, I and D). In order to represent the
    functional properties of such receptors, we have developed a
    kinetic model that links conformational interconversion rates
    to agonist binding and extends the general principles of the
    Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allosteric transitions. The
    crucial assumption is that the linkage is controlled by the
    position of the interconversion transition states on a
    hypothetical linear reaction coordinate. Application of the
    model to the peripheral nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)
    accounts for the main properties of ligand-gating, including
    single-channel events, and several new relationships are
    predicted. Kinetic simulations reveal errors inherent in using
    the dose-response analysis, but justify its application under
    defined conditions. The model predicts that (in order to
    overcome the intrinsic stability of the B state and to produce
    the appropriate cooperativity) channel activation is driven by
    an A state with a Kd in the 50 nM range, hence some 140-fold
    stronger than the apparent affinity of the open state deduced
    previously. According to the model, recovery from the
    desensitized states may occur via rapid transit through the A
    state with minimal channel opening, thus without necessarily
    undergoing a distinct recovery pathway, as assumed in the
    standard &apos;cycle&apos; model. Transitions to the desensitized states
    by low concentration &apos;pre-pulses&apos; are predicted to occur
    without significant channel opening, but equilibrium values of
    IC50 can be obtained only with long pre-pulse times.
    Predictions are also made concerning allosteric effectors and
    their possible role in coincidence detection. In terms of
    future developments, the analysis presented here provides a
    physical basis for constructing more biologically realistic
    models of synaptic modulation that may be applied to artificial
    neural networks.</p>
