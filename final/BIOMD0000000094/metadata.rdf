    <u>NCBS Curation Comments:</u>
          This model shows the control mechanism of Jak-Stat pathway, here SOCS1 (Suppressor of cytokine signaling-I) was identified as the negative regulator of Jak and STAT signal transduction pathway. This is the knockout version of Jak-Stat pathway in this model the SOCS1 has been knocked out i.e it formation is not shown. The graphs are almost similar to the graphs as shown in the paper but STAT1n graph has some ambiguities. Thanks to Dr Satoshi Yamada for clarifying some of those ambiguities and providing the values used in simulations.      </p>

      <u>Biomodels Curation Comments:</u>
          The model reproduces the figures 2 (B,D,F,H,J,L,N) corresponding to JAK/STAT activation in SOCS1 knock out cells. The model was successfully tested on MathSBML      </p>
