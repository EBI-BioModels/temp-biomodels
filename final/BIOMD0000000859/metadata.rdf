  <pre>This is a global mathematical model describing metabolic partitioning of carbon resources in plants between growth and defense, as a function of nitrate fertilization. The model hinges on the dynamics of sucrose inflow/outflow properties. The model also accounts for variations in photosynthetic activity as dictated by a daily light/dark cycle. Furthermore, the adaptive changes in starch metabolism that occur with changing light durations (short days vs long days) are also investigated.</pre>
