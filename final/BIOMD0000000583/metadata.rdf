    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Clostridium difficile infections are associated with the use
    of broad-spectrum antibiotics and result in an exuberant
    inflammatory response, leading to nosocomial diarrhea, colitis
    and even death. To better understand the dynamics of mucosal
    immunity during C. difficile infection from initiation through
    expansion to resolution, we built a computational model of the
    mucosal immune response to the bacterium. The model was
    calibrated using data from a mouse model of C. difficile
    infection. The model demonstrates a crucial role of T helper 17
    (Th17) effector responses in the colonic lamina propria and
    luminal commensal bacteria populations in the clearance of C.
    difficile and colonic pathology, whereas regulatory T (Treg)
    cells responses are associated with the recovery phase. In
    addition, the production of anti-microbial peptides by inflamed
    epithelial cells and activated neutrophils in response to C.
    difficile infection inhibit the re-growth of beneficial
    commensal bacterial species. Computational simulations suggest
    that the removal of neutrophil and epithelial cell derived
    anti-microbial inhibitions, separately and together, on
    commensal bacterial regrowth promote recovery and minimize
    colonic inflammatory pathology. Simulation results predict a
    decrease in colonic inflammatory markers, such as neutrophilic
    influx and Th17 cells in the colonic lamina propria, and length
    of infection with accelerated commensal bacteria re-growth
    through altered anti-microbial inhibition. Computational
    modeling provides novel insights on the therapeutic value of
    repopulating the colonic microbiome and inducing regulatory
    mucosal immune responses during C. difficile infection. Thus,
    modeling mucosal immunity-gut microbiota interactions has the
    potential to guide the development of targeted fecal
    transplantation therapies in the context of precision medicine
    interventions.</p>
