    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Tryptophan is utilized in various metabolic routes including
    protein synthesis, serotonin, and melatonin synthesis and the
    kynurenine pathway. Perturbations in these pathways have been
    associated with neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Here we
    present a comprehensive kinetic model of the complex network of
    human tryptophan metabolism based upon existing kinetic data
    for all enzymatic conversions and transporters. By integrating
    tissue-specific expression data, modeling tryptophan metabolism
    in liver and brain returned intermediate metabolite
    concentrations in the physiological range. Sensitivity and
    metabolic control analyses identified expected key enzymes to
    govern fluxes in the branches of the network. Combining
    tissue-specific models revealed a considerable impact of the
    kynurenine pathway in liver on the concentrations of
    neuroactive derivatives in the brain. Moreover, using
    expression data from a cancer study predicted metabolite
    changes that resembled the experimental observations. We
    conclude that the combination of the kinetic model with
    expression data represents a powerful diagnostic tool to
    predict alterations in tryptophan metabolism. The model is
    readily scalable to include more tissues, thereby enabling
    assessment of organismal tryptophan metabolism in health and
    disease.</p>
