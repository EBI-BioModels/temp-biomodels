            <div class="bibo:abstract">
              <p>In this study, we have developed a multiscale systems model
    of interleukin (IL)-6-mediated immune regulation in Crohn&apos;s
    disease, by integrating intracellular signaling with
    organ-level dynamics of pharmacological markers underlying the
    disease. This model was linked to a general pharmacokinetic
    model for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and used to
    comparatively study various biotherapeutic strategies targeting
    IL-6-mediated signaling in Crohn&apos;s disease. Our work
    illustrates techniques to develop mechanistic models of disease
    biology to study drug-system interaction. Despite a sparse
    training data set, predictions of the model were qualitatively
    validated by clinical biomarker data from a pilot trial with
    tocilizumab. Model-based analysis suggests that strategies
    targeting IL-6, IL-6R?, or the IL-6/sIL-6R? complex are less
    effective at suppressing pharmacological markers of Crohn&apos;s
    than dual targeting the IL-6/sIL-6R? complex in addition to
    IL-6 or IL-6R?. The potential value of multiscale system
    pharmacology modeling in drug discovery and development is also
    discussed.CPT: Pharmacometrics &amp; Systems Pharmacology
