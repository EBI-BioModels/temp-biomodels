    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>PURPOSE: This tumor response pharmacodynamic model aims to
    describe primary lesion shrinkage in non-small cell lung cancer
    over time and determine if concentration-based exposure metrics
    for gemcitabine or that of its metabolites,
    2&apos;,2&apos;-difluorodeoxyuridine or gemcitabine triphosphate, are
    better than gemcitabine dose for prediction of individual
    response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gemcitabine was given thrice
    weekly on days 1 and 8 in combination with carboplatin, which
    was given only on day 1 of every cycle. Gemcitabine amount in
    the body and area under the concentration-time curves of plasma
    gemcitabine, 2&apos;,2&apos;-difluorodeoxyuridine, and intracellular
    gemcitabine triphosphate in white cells were compared to
    determine which best describes tumor shrinkage over time. Tumor
    growth kinetics were described using a Gompertz-like model.
    RESULTS: The apparent half-life for the effect of gemcitabine
    was 7.67 weeks. The tumor turnover time constant was 21.8
    week.cm. Baseline tumor size and gemcitabine amount in the body
    to attain 50% of tumor shrinkage were estimated to be 6.66 cm
    and 10,600 mg. There was no evidence of relapse during
    treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Concentration-based exposure metrics
    for gemcitabine and its metabolites were no better than
    gemcitabine amount in predicting tumor shrinkage in primary
    lung cancer lesions. Gemcitabine dose-based models did
    marginally better than treatment-based models that ignored
    doses of drug administered to patients. Modeling tumor
    shrinkage in primary lesions can be used to quantify individual
    sensitivity and response to antitumor effects of anticancer
    drugs.</p>
