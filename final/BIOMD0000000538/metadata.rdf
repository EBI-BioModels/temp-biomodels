    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>In genetic disorders associated with premature neuronal
    death, symptoms may not appear for years or decades. This delay
    in clinical onset is often assumed to reflect the occurrence of
    age-dependent cumulative damage. For example, it has been
    suggested that oxidative stress disrupts metabolism in
    neurological degenerative disorders by the cumulative damage of
    essential macromolecules. A prediction of the cumulative damage
    hypothesis is that the probability of cell death will increase
    over time. Here we show in contrast that the kinetics of
    neuronal death in 12 models of photoreceptor degeneration,
    hippocampal neurons undergoing excitotoxic cell death, a mouse
    model of cerebellar degeneration and Parkinson&apos;s and
    Huntington&apos;s diseases are all exponential and better explained
    by mathematical models in which the risk of cell death remains
    constant or decreases exponentially with age. These kinetics
    argue against the cumulative damage hypothesis; instead, the
    time of death of any neuron is random. Our findings are most
    simply accommodated by a &apos;one-hit&apos; biochemical model in which
    mutation imposes a mutant steady state on the neuron and a
    single event randomly initiates cell death. This model appears
    to be common to many forms of neurodegeneration and has
    implications for therapeutic strategies.</p>
