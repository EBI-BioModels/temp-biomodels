  <pre>This is a mathematical model describing the formation of long-term potentiation (LTP) at the Schaffer collateral of CA1 pyramidal cell synapse. The model consists of nine ordinary differential equations that denote synaptic states associated with different degrees of LTP, as well as the levels of regulatory proteins involved in the formation and maintenance of LTP.</pre>
