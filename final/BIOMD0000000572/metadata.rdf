    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>Biomedical research and biotechnological production are
    greatly benefiting from the results provided by the development
    of dynamic models of microbial metabolism. Although several
    kinetic models of Lactococcus lactis (a Lactic Acid Bacterium
    (LAB) commonly used in the dairy industry) have been developed
    so far, most of them are simplified and focus only on specific
    metabolic pathways. Therefore, the application of mathematical
    models in the design of an engineering strategy for the
    production of industrially important products by L. lactis has
    been very limited. In this work, we extend the existing kinetic
    model of L. lactis central metabolism to include industrially
    relevant production pathways such as mannitol and
    2,3-butanediol. In this way, we expect to study the dynamics of
    metabolite production and make predictive simulations in L.
    lactis. We used a system of ordinary differential equations
    (ODEs) with approximate Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics for each
    reaction, where the parameters were estimated from multivariate
    time-series metabolite concentrations obtained by our team
    through in vivo Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The results
    show that the model captures observed transient dynamics when
    validated under a wide range of experimental conditions.
    Furthermore, we analyzed the model using global perturbations,
    which corroborate experimental evidence about metabolic
    responses upon enzymatic changes. These include that mannitol
    production is very sensitive to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in
    the wild type (W.T.) strain, and to mannitol
    phosphoenolpyruvate: a phosphotransferase system (PTS(Mtl)) in
    a LDH mutant strain. LDH reduction has also a positive control
    on 2,3-butanediol levels. Furthermore, it was found that
    overproduction of mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (MPD) in a
    LDH/PTS(Mtl) deficient strain can increase the mannitol levels.
    The results show that this model has prediction capability over
    new experimental conditions and offers promising possibilities
    to elucidate the effect of alterations in the main metabolism
    of L. lactis, with application in strain optimization.</p>
