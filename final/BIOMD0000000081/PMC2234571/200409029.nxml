This study concerns the kinetics and mechanism of M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic receptor&#x02013;mediated regulation of the cloned neuronal M channel, KCNQ2/KCNQ3 (Kv7.2/Kv7.3). Receptors, channels, various mutated G-protein subunits, and an optical probe for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) were coexpressed by transfection in tsA-201 cells, and the cells were studied by whole-cell patch clamp and by confocal microscopy. Constitutively active forms of G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub> and G&#x003b1;<sub>11</sub>, but not G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub>, caused a loss of the plasma membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> and a total tonic inhibition of the KCNQ current. There were no further changes upon addition of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M (oxo-M). Expression of the regulator of G-protein signaling, RGS2, blocked PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis and current suppression by muscarinic stimulation, confirming that the G<sub>q</sub> family of G-proteins is necessary. Dialysis with the competitive inhibitor GDP&#x003b2;S (1 mM) lengthened the time constant of inhibition sixfold, decreased the suppression of current, and decreased agonist sensitivity. Removal of intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> slowed both the development and the recovery from muscarinic suppression. When combined with GDP&#x003b2;S, low intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> nearly eliminated muscarinic inhibition. With nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs, current suppression developed spontaneously and muscarinic inhibition was enhanced. Such spontaneous suppression was antagonized by GDP&#x003b2;S or GTP or by expression of RGS2. These observations were successfully described by a kinetic model representing biochemical steps of the signaling cascade using published rate constants where available. The model supports the following sequence of events for this G<sub>q</sub>-coupled signaling: A classical G-protein cycle, including competition for nucleotide-free G-protein by all nucleotide forms and an activation step requiring Mg<sup>2+</sup>, followed by G-protein&#x02013;stimulated phospholipase C and hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2</sub>, and finally PIP<sub>2</sub> dissociation from binding sites for inositol lipid on the channels so that KCNQ current was suppressed. Further experiments will be needed to refine some untested assumptions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>M-current</kwd><kwd>M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic receptor</kwd><kwd>phospholipase C</kwd><kwd>magnesium</kwd><kwd>PIP<sub>2</sub></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Wiebke Hirdes's present address is Institut f&#x000fc;r Angewandte Physiologie, Universit&#x000e4;tsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Universit&#x000e4;t Hamburg, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.</p></fn><fn><p>Lisa F.

The first biochemical experiments on the G-proteins G<sub>s</sub>, G<sub>o</sub>, G<sub>i</sub>, and transducin identified a cycle of conformational changes that activates and deactivates G-proteins (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Schramm and Selinger, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Birnbaumer et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Stryer, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gilman, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ross, 1995</xref>). These test-tube studies used purified protein components to measure rates of action of GTP and GDP analogs, AlF<sub>4</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> on nucleotide binding, tryptophan fluorescence, and proteolytic susceptibility of the G-protein &#x003b1;-subunit. They identified steps of guanine nucleotide exchange and guanine nucleotide hydrolysis. Similar kinetic steps were subsequently recognized in electrophysiological work on G<sub>o</sub>-, G<sub>i</sub>-, and transducin-dependent pathways of ion channel gating (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sather and Detwiler, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Breitwieser and Szabo, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pfaffinger, 1988</xref>). Using both G-protein&#x02013;activated inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels in heart and cyclic-nucleotide&#x02013;gated channels in photoreceptors, such early work revealed the physiological kinetics of G-protein signaling in intact cells. In the case of photoreceptors, kinetic models could then be formulated to describe the kinetics of phototransduction (for review see <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Arshavsky et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Our goal is to carry out a similar biophysical analysis on a signaling pathway that uses G-proteins of the G<sub>q</sub> family. Biochemical experiments with purified G<sub>q</sub> and its relatives have identified &#x003b1;-subunits of the G<sub>q</sub> family as the activators of phospholipase C-&#x003b2;s (PLC-&#x003b2;), the enzymes that cleave the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) into diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sternweis and Smrcka, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Singer et al., 1997</xref>). During activation in vitro, G<sub>q</sub> steps through a cycle of nucleotide exchange and nucleotide hydrolysis like that of other G-proteins. The kinetics of these steps have been studied with purified components in lipid vesicles (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mukhopadhyay and Ross, 1999</xref>); however, less is known about the physiological kinetics in cells (see e.g., <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pfaffinger, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lopez, 1992</xref>). Here we have monitored downstream actions of PLC in intact cells as measures of G<sub>q</sub> activation while perturbing the system with GTP and GDP analogs, AlF<sub>4</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. As an indicator of PLC activity, we use principally the modulation of an ion channel, but we also use the translocation of a fluorescent reporter protein that is a probe for both a substrate and a product of PLC. With electrophysiology and confocal imaging, we have been able to follow the kinetics of G<sub>q</sub> signaling, from which we have begun to formulate a preliminary kinetic model of its time course.</p><p>Our main PLC indicator is the voltage-dependent M-current, which can be suppressed by activating M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic receptors or other receptors linked to G<sub>q</sub> (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Yu, 2000</xref>). A role for G-proteins in M-current modulation was recognized early by an irreversible inhibition of the current when compounds known to activate G-proteins, such as guanosine-5&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP&#x003b3;S), guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (GppNHp), or AlF<sub>4</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, were applied intracellularly with or without muscarinic agonists (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pfaffinger, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1989</xref>). Evidence has accumulated that the G-protein involved belongs to the G<sub>q/11</sub> family (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pfaffinger, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Caulfield et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Haley et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Shapiro et al., 2000</xref>). It is likely that different G-protein subtypes of the G<sub>q/11</sub> family participate in the transmitter modulation of M-current depending on the cell, receptor subtype, and species (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Simmons and Mather, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Haley et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The primary signal for suppression and recovery of M-current is the G-protein&#x02013;mediated hydrolysis and depletion of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the plasma membrane via activation of PLC, followed by resynthesis of PIP<sub>2</sub>. Muscarinic inhibition of the M-current is blocked by an inhibitor of PLC, recovery from inhibition requires cytosolic hydrolyzable ATP, and recovery is blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Suh and Hille, 2002</xref>). The M-current can be depressed by depleting PIP<sub>2</sub> with antibodies or with polycations, and it can be reactivated by perfusion of PIP<sub>2</sub> after suppression by rundown or exposure to agonists of G<sub>q</sub>-coupled receptors (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The other indicator of PLC activity that we use here is a fluorescent probe that binds to PIP<sub>2</sub> in the membrane and to IP<sub>3</sub> in the cytoplasm. This protein construct (PH-EGFP), a fusion protein of the PH domain of PLC-&#x003b4;1 with enhanced green fluorescent protein, can be expressed in cell lines and observed by confocal microscopy in living cells (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stauffer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Varnai and Balla, 1998</xref>). In resting cells, with PIP<sub>2</sub> in the plasma membrane and no cytoplasmic IP<sub>3</sub>, the PH-EGFP protein binds to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, with little elsewhere in the cell. After PLC has been activated, the probe migrates into the cytoplasm both because of the loss of membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> and because of the generation of cytoplasmic IP<sub>3</sub> when PLC is active (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stauffer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hirose et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2003</xref>; unpublished data).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells for Electrophysiology</title><p>We express the M-current from its KCNQ2/KCNQ3 (Kv7.2/Kv7.3) channel subunits in a cell line together with M<sub>1</sub> receptors. Plasmids encoding the channel subunits, KCNQ2 (EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF110020">AF110020</ext-link>) and KCNQ3 (EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF091247">AF091247</ext-link>), provided by David McKinnon (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY), were subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression plasmid (Invitrogen). A plasmid containing mouse M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic receptor was provided by Neil Nathanson (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Plasmids with cloned human RGS2 and constitutively active forms of human G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub> (Q209L), human G&#x003b1;<sub>11</sub> (Q209L), and human G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub> (Q226L) were obtained from the Guthrie Research Institute. The plasmids encoding KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits, the muscarinic M<sub>1</sub> receptor, and sometimes the G&#x003b1;-subunits were transiently cotransfected into human tsA-201 cells (tsA; derived from HEK293 cells) using lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), together with cDNA-encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker for successfully transfected cells (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Shapiro et al., 2000</xref>). The 2-ml transfection medium usually contained 0.1 &#x003bc;g of GFP cDNA and 1 &#x003bc;g of each of the other cDNAs. The next day, the cells were plated onto poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine&#x02013;coated coverslip chips, and fluorescent cells were studied within 2 d in electrophysiological experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Confocal Imaging</title><p>For the fluorescence measurements of PLC activation, we used a fluorescent indicator of PIP<sub>2</sub> and IP<sub>3</sub>. The tsA cells were cotransfected with 0.25 &#x003bc;g cDNA for PH<sub>PLC-&#x003b4;1</sub>-EGFP (PH-EGFP) (gift of Tobias Meyer, Stanford), 1 &#x003bc;g cDNA for M<sub>1</sub> receptors, and 2 &#x003bc;g cDNA for G&#x003b1;-subunits, if used, then transferred to poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine&#x02013;coated glass coverslips. 1 or 2 d after transfection, the coverslips were mounted in a perfusion chamber designed for a Leica TCS NT inverted confocal microscope. Live cells were imaged using a 63&#x000d7; water objective at 23&#x000b0;C. Control images were obtained for 1 min before drug application. The agonist oxo-M (10 &#x003bc;M) was applied by gravity feed. Images were processed with Metamorph (UIC) and Igor Pro (WaveMetrics) to obtain the time course of the average fluorescence intensity <italic>F</italic> in a cytoplasmic region normalized to the average intensity for 30 s before agonist application <italic>F</italic>

In one control experiment, confocal immunocytochemistry was used with fixed cells and anti-KCNQ2 and -KCNQ3 antibodies to ascertain trafficking of KCNQ channel subunits, as described (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Roche et al., 2002</xref>). The cells were observed with a BioRad MRC 600 microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Current Recording and Analysis</title><p>The whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used to voltage-clamp and dialyze cells at 22&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C. Electrodes pulled from glass micropipette tubes (VWR Scientific) had resistances of 1.3&#x02013;2.5 M&#x003a9;. The whole-cell access resistance was 2&#x02013;4 M&#x003a9;, and series-resistance error was compensated &#x0003e;60%. Fast and slow capacitances were compensated before the applied test-pulse sequences. When measuring the rates of induction and recovery from muscarinic inhibition of the current, we applied test and control solutions rapidly to the 100-&#x003bc;l chamber (flow rate of 1.5 ml/min) in the vicinity of the recorded cell. Tests using junction-potential measurements on an open pipette showed that solutions changed with a mean exponential time constant of 2.4 s, and the change began with a 4&#x02013;8 s delay after the command that switches the valve. Thus, there is an uncertainty of at least 4 s about the time of beginning (but not the duration) of the agonist exposure. In the figures, the bar representing solution change is usually drawn 8 s after the electronic command occurred. In separate experiments, we estimated the dialysis time for substances included in the whole-cell pipette by measuring the time course of fluorescence rise of cells after breakthrough with a pipette containing the fluorescent dye, indo-1. For indo-1 (M.W. = 645) the diffusion had an exponential time constant, &#x003c4; &#x0223c;120 s. As GDP and GTP analogues have similar molecular weights (460&#x02013;540), we assumed that they also exchange into the cell with the same time constant as indo-1.</p><p>Currents were monitored by holding the cell at &#x02212;20 mV and applying a 500-ms hyperpolarizing step to &#x02212;60 mV every 4 s. For brevity, we will call the current from expressed KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits, KCNQ current. The amplitude of the KCNQ current usually was defined as the outward current at the &#x02212;20-mV holding potential sensitive to block by 30 &#x003bc;M of the channel blocker linopirdine. Time courses give the KCNQ current plotted every 4 s, except where noted. The agonist oxo-M was always applied at 10 &#x003bc;M unless noted. In most experiments with pipette solutions containing nucleotide analogs, we waited &#x0003e;300 s after breakthrough before applying oxo-M to allow time for the dialysis of the analogues into the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec><title>Solutions and Materials</title><p>The external Ringer's solution used for current recording and confocal observations contained (in mM): 160 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, and 8 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH.

We have shown in this system that M<sub>1</sub> receptor&#x02013;coupled cleavage of PIP<sub>2</sub> suppresses the KCNQ K<sup>+</sup> current of exogenously expressed KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels and evokes intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by an IP<sub>3</sub>-dependent pathway (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Shapiro et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Suh and Hille, 2002</xref>). We start by confirming that PLC is coupled to G<sub>q</sub> in these cells.</p><p>TsA cells were transfected with the PH-EGFP probe and M<sub>1</sub> receptors, with or without constitutively active, mutant forms of G-protein &#x003b1; subunits. As expected, the PH-EGFP probe, which has affinity for membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> and cytoplasmic IP<sub>3</sub>, was concentrated mainly at the cell surface in unstimulated control cells (circumferential dark regions in top left panel of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Bath application of oxo-M led to a rapid translocation (time constant, &#x003c4; = &#x0223c;13 s) of the fluorescent probe from the membrane to the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). This translocation was slowly reversed after removal of oxo-M, recovering on average by 63% in &#x0223c;100 s (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). However, when cells were cotransfected with a constitutively active G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub> subunit (G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>*), most of the PH-EGFP probe was already found in the cytoplasm in resting cells, and additional incubation with oxo-M did not change the distribution of fluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Similarly, transfection with a constitutively active mutant of another G<sub>q</sub> family protein, G&#x003b1;<sub>11</sub>*, induced a cytoplasmic distribution of PH-EGFP in resting cells, and there was no further movement of the probe with oxo-M. As a control, transfection with constitutively active G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub>* did not displace PH-EGFP from the membrane or prevent the translocation seen with oxo-M (although the induced translocation was weaker). These data indicate that exogenous G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>* and G&#x003b1;<sub>11</sub>*, but not G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub>*, can couple to PLC to activate potent PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis in tsA cells.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>F<sc>igure</sc> 1. </label><caption><p>Constitutively active G<sub>q</sub> proteins and RGS2 alter PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis in transfected tsA cells.

Black circles in the top panels represent cytoplasmic areas selected for calculation of mean fluorescence intensity <italic>F</italic>. The cell nucleus is made evident by the oxo-M treatment in the top and bottom panels where there is transiently more probe in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus.

The currents were similar to those seen in tsA cells not transfected with KCNQ2/KCNQ3 subunits. One explanation for the lack of KCNQ current in these cells might have been that expression of G<sub>q</sub>* prevented the trafficking of KCNQ channels to the cell membrane. This possibility was ruled out by control immunocytochemical experiments using antibodies against KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 proteins. In control cells, immunoreactivity for both antibodies was distributed almost entirely at the cell surface and superpositions showed complete overlap of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). In G<sub>q</sub>-expressing cells the distribution of immunoreactivity was indistinguishable from that in control cells. KCNQ currents were also absent with expression of G&#x003b1;<sub>11</sub>*, but not with G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub>*. However, with G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub>* expression, the action of oxo-M was somewhat slowed and reduced, both as measured by PH-EGFP translocation and by KCNQ current suppression.

As expected, GDP&#x003b2;S (middle) decreased the apparent potency of 0.1 &#x003bc;M oxo-M in comparison to GTP, whereas GTP&#x003b3;S (bottom) enhanced it greatly. <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B shows the resulting dose&#x02013;response curves for current inhibition measured after 3 min in agonist. The EC<sub>50</sub> values for channel inhibition differ by more than two orders of magnitude: 1.1 &#x003bc;M, 103 nM, and 5 nM for GDP&#x003b2;S/GTP, GTP, and GTP&#x003b3;S/GTP in the pipette solution. In each case, the rate of current suppression fell as the oxo-M concentration was decreased (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>). As in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, the initial inhibition rate was greatly slowed when GDP&#x003b2;S was present in the pipette, whereas it was not changed with GTP&#x003b3;S. Additional experiments showed that the effective dose&#x02013;response relation also could be shifted to the left by GppNHp in the pipette solution (to 76 nM with 0.05 mM GppNHp + 0.05 GTP), but not by AlF<sub>4</sub>

They also reemphasize that the EC<sub>50</sub> of the dose&#x02013;response curve for physiological outputs is not a direct measure of receptor occupancy for a G-protein&#x02013;coupled receptor. The EC<sub>50</sub> is the bottom line of a long cascade of events and can be altered over orders of magnitude by agents that may have little effect on receptor occupancy.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>F<sc>igure</sc> 8. </label><caption><p>Nucleotide analogues shift the dose&#x02013;response relationship for muscarinic inhibition of current.

It therefore seemed worthwhile to test our understanding by an explicit kinetic model incorporating all of the postulated steps (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). We wanted to see how far the full range of our observations could be explained by assembling simple concepts and kinetic measurements from the literature into a larger model. We consider this model a first approximation to be refined by future experiments. It has three conceptual components: First, the G-protein cycle of G<sub>q</sub> and several side reactions with nucleotide analogues determine the number of active G-proteins. Then, phosphoinositide synthesis and breakdown determine PIP<sub>2</sub> levels. Finally, the PIP<sub>2</sub> level in the membrane governs the KCNQ current amplitude.</p><fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>F<sc>igure</sc> 10. </label><caption><p>Kinetic model used to simulate muscarinic modulation of KCNQ current.

Step 3, the breakdown of PIP<sub>2</sub> by the enzyme PLC, is activated by the active forms of G<sub>q</sub>.

Our kinetic assumptions would be literally correct if the relevant receptors, G-proteins, and PLC molecules existed and remained in 1:1:1 stoichiometric complexes throughout, a concept that has been suggested for G<sub>q</sub> and PLC (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Biddlecome et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the readout of these events comes from KCNQ channels. The model assumes that PIP<sub>2</sub> binds reversibly and relatively slowly (seconds) to saturable sites on KCNQ channels, step 6. Each channel has fourfold symmetry and probably binds a minimum of four PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules per channel. We chose a power law with an exponent of 1.8 for the activation of the channel by the bound PIP<sub>2</sub> (see ).</p><p>The level of PIP<sub>2</sub> needed to keep KCNQ channels active should not be far below the resting level in the membrane, since the lag before channels begin to close during strong receptor activation is short. Thus, we chose a midpoint for KCNQ activation at 43% of the resting PIP<sub>2</sub> level, which meant that KCNQ channels are 72% activated at the resting PIP<sub>2</sub> level. The resting PIP<sub>2</sub> level should be enough to make several micromolar IP<sub>3</sub> if broken down all at once. We used a value of 5,000 &#x003bc;m<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> for PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">McLaughlin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2003</xref>), enough to make 5 &#x003bc;M IP<sub>3</sub> in the cytoplasm and nucleus. With a 10 &#x003bc;M oxo-M stimulus, most of the PIP<sub>2</sub> should be hydrolyzed by 15 s so that channels close. After agonist action, enough of the PIP<sub>2</sub> should be restored in &#x0223c;300 s so that channels can reopen. When PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis is stopped (as with wortmannin), PIP<sub>2</sub> levels should decay over 15 min (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Willars et al., 1998</xref>) and KCNQ current should run down in that time (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Suh and Hille, 2002</xref>). We chose nearly matching resting synthesis and breakdown of PIP<sub>2</sub> at a rate that would turn over the entire PIP<sub>2</sub> pool with an exponential time constant of 100 s. About half of this turnover goes via a futile cycle of PIP<sub>2</sub> 5-phosphatase back to PIP. Net replenishment of PIP<sub>2</sub> all the way from PI would have a longer time constant (&#x0003e;200 s). If every G-protein could be simultaneously in an active state, the PLC rate would increase 1,330-fold over the basal level and the PIP<sub>2</sub> pool would be hydrolyzed with a time constant of 210 ms. With the rate constants chosen and a 0.1 mM GTP solution in the pipette, only 21% of the G-proteins are simultaneously in the active G&#x000b7;GTP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> state during a saturating agonist application, and only 13% during application of 10 &#x003bc;M oxo-M.</p><p>The Virtual Cell environment used in running the model (see <sc>materials</sc>

The KCNQ current responds to PIP<sub>2</sub> changes nonlinearly and with a delay governed by the kinetics of the reversible phospholipid binding to the activation sites on the channel (step 06). Thus, the minimum of KCNQ current is reached after the minimum of PIP<sub>2</sub>.

The extent of activation of the signaling pathway depends on the balance between formation of nucleotide-free G-protein, followed by binding of GTP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, versus the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Analogues act by competing with GTP for the nucleotide-free form. When cast as a kinetic model, many aspects of the observations are described qualitatively.

The role originally attributed to RGS proteins was purely to shorten the lifetime of an active G-protein by accelerating the GTP hydrolysis step. However, the newer experiments have shown that RGS2 specifically forms a trimeric complex with the M<sub>1</sub> receptor and activated G<sub>q</sub>, thus blocking access of effectors (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein et al., 2004</xref>). This additional action accounts for the intensity of the block and the ability to affect actions of GTPase-resistant nucleotides. We did not incorporate RGS proteins in our model as we had no experiments with graded RGS concentrations. However, a simple approach that would fit the data is to have them sequester activated G<sub>q</sub> as an inactive complex until the bound GTP is broken down.</p></sec><sec><title>GDP&#x003b2;S</title><p>GDP&#x003b2;S was developed as an inhibitor of G-protein activation that competed with GTP and GTP analogues for the nucleotide-free form of G-proteins (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Eckstein et al., 1979</xref>). The probability of capture in the competition for free G is proportional to the concentrations and the on-rate constants (<italic>k</italic>

Like previous investigators (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pfaffinger, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Lopez and Adams, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Simmons and Mather, 1991</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>), we found that pipette solutions with a large excess of GDP&#x003b2;S over GTP slow and diminish agonist-induced inhibition of M-current. The GDP&#x003b2;S also prolongs action after the agonist is removed. In frog sympathetic neurons, the block by GDP&#x003b2;S of suppression by agonists was small and grew with repetitive applications of the same agonist (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Simmons and Mather, 1991</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>).</p><p>Because 1 mM GDP&#x003b2;S still allowed an 80% inhibition of KCNQ current in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, one might think that the effect of the GTP-free GDP&#x003b2;S solution is weak. However, 10 &#x003bc;M oxo-M is a supra-maximal dose of agonist, and the significant strength of GDP&#x003b2;S action should be judged instead by noting that it slowed the rate of suppression of current sixfold (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B), shifted the oxo-M dose&#x02013;response curve10-fold (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B), and reduced the response to a 4-s oxo-M application by &#x0003e;90% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). The slowed onset of inhibition is readily understood as a high probability of capturing free G<sub>q</sub> as G&#x000b7;GDP&#x003b2;S instead of as G&#x000b7;GTP. In the model, the G&#x000b7;GDP&#x003b2;S complex forms reversibly and within a few seconds it dissociates to free G again; the competition reoccurs, and once more GDP&#x003b2;S is the likely winner. Eventually, however, GTP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> will bind, giving a brief stimulation of PLC, and then the GTP is hydrolyzed to restore the resting form, G&#x000b7;GDP. In this way, formation of G&#x003b1;&#x000b7;GTP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> occurs but is much delayed by cycles of repeated GDP&#x003b2;S binding, so it may occur well after agonist has been removed. Although the model has this delayed activation, the amount is much less than is seen in the experiments. To get significant delayed activation by this mechanism requires that the dissociation rate constant for the G&#x000b7;GDP&#x003b2;S complex be significantly faster than that for the G&#x000b7;GDP complex in agonist-free conditions. Another explanation is given in the next paragraph.</p><p>The original description of GDP&#x003b2;S showed that it can be phosphorylated slowly by cellular enzymes to yield G<underline>T</underline>P&#x003b2;S (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Eckstein et al., 1979</xref>), and subsequent work suggests that GTP&#x003b2;S acts as a very weak persistent activator (weak &#x0201c;partial agonist&#x0201d;) of G-proteins (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Paris and Pouyssegur, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Blank et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Paris and Eckstein, 1992</xref>). Thus, after some minutes of whole-cell dialysis with GDP&#x003b2;S, some weak persistent activation could develop by formation of GTP&#x003b2;S. We could mimic such an effect by including, e.g., 0.0004 mM GTP&#x003b3;S in our calculations for 1 mM GDP&#x003b2;S. The simulation (unpublished data) gave better agreement with the near lack of recovery after oxo-M inhibition in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, suggesting that some GTP&#x003b2;S did form (converting &#x0003c;0.1% of the GDP&#x003b2;S) in our experiments.</p><p>The original description of GDP&#x003b2;S also showed for the G-protein G<sub>s</sub> that, like GDP dissociation from G&#x000b7;GDP, GDP&#x003b2;S dissociation from G&#x000b7;GDP&#x003b2;S is speeded by receptor occupancy (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Eckstein et al., 1979</xref>). We included a 20-fold speeding of the binding and unbinding reactions for G<sub>q</sub> in the model with the affinity for GDP&#x003b2;S not changing; however, this property has not been explored further for any G-protein, so there was little information to constrain our assumptions. If such speeding is correct for GDP&#x003b2;S, one wonders if it would also be found for other nucleotide analogs, at least before the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dissociation of G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits. In bullfrog neurons where GDP&#x003b2;S gives an accumulating block under repeated agonist application, the G&#x000b7;GDP&#x003b2;S complex might be stable over many seconds even in the presence of agonist. Indeed <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Simmons and Mather (1992)</xref> suggested an irreversible removal of G-proteins from the available pool. The dissociation in our model for tsA cells is too rapid to produce such use dependent depletion.</p></sec><sec><title>Agonist-independent Turnover of G Protein</title><p>Like previous investigators (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pfaffinger, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Lopez and Adams, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lopez, 1992</xref>), we found that pipette solutions with GTP&#x003b3;S, GppNHp, or AlF<sub>4</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> lead to spontaneous suppression of M-current over 100&#x02013;800 s. Our experiments with different concentrations of GTP&#x003b3;S showed that the analogue concentration is rate limiting, and experiments with added GTP showed that the GTP/analogue ratio is important (see also <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Breitwieser and Szabo, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lopez, 1992</xref>).

To get an exponential fall of current with our model, one would need a small fraction of G-proteins (and hence PLC) to be activated initially, with no subsequent increase in this active fraction. However, in our calculations, the cytoplasmic concentration of, e.g., GTP&#x003b3;S, starts at zero (at <italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;20 s) and rises gradually, so that the irreversible formation of active G-proteins occurs at an ever-accelerating predicted rate that is initially very low. For GTP&#x003b3;S and GppNHp, the model has a further lag in onset that comes from the time needed for antagonistic GTP to diffuse out of the cytoplasm. In the calculation, we assumed that GTP concentration decays exponentially to a basal level of 1 &#x003bc;M. By the time that the action of GppNHp develops, the cytoplasmic GTP is nearly gone. Therefore, the on-rate constant chosen for GppNHp depends almost directly on this assumed residual GTP concentration. The higher the residual GTP, the higher the required GppNHp on-rate constant would have been.</p><p>The model could be changed to get an early, weak G-protein activation and an exponential time course of spontaneous current decay. One would assume that GTP&#x003b3;S binds much more quickly (1,000&#x000d7;) than here and that the resulting complex is much less potent (&#x0223c;1%) than a GTP complex in stimulating PLC. However, such a modification goes against the accepted concept that GTP&#x003b3;S is a strong activator of G-proteins.</p><p>For GTP&#x003b3;S and GppNHp, the deduced on-rate constants are several orders of magnitude lower than the on-rates of GTP and GDP&#x003b2;S, and the on-rate for GppNHp is very much lower than for GTP&#x003b3;S. These low values suffice in <xref rid="fig17" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref> because there remains little GTP to compete against when the analogues are binding, and because only a few G-proteins need be permanently activated. A 1% activation of PLC suffices to explain the observed slow suppression of KCNQ current. The small amount of activation needed and the observed concentration dependence of the time course for GTP&#x003b3;S action argue against using such time courses as estimates of the absolute rate of dissociation of GDP from G&#x000b7;GDP, as might be tempting to do. In our model, the spontaneous resting rate of GDP dissociation has a time constant of 1,000 s.</p><p>We have emphasized the competition for free G embodied in steps 20, 21, 22, 23, and &#x02212;10. The agreement is qualitative as we did not find a set of rate constants that worked optimally across the full range of conditions studied. Thus, the effect of GDP&#x003b2;S is a little strong in <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figs. 12</xref> and <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">13</xref> and a little weak in <xref rid="fig18" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref>, and the antagonistic effect of GTP is fine for the combination of GppNHp with GTP in <xref rid="fig17" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref> but it is too weak in an analogous calculation (unpublished data) for the combination of GTP&#x003b3;S with GTP. We think that some deviations result from not knowing how much GDP or GTP is present in resting cells and how much might remain in the cell during dialysis with GDP- and GTP-free solutions. The model fit could be improved by assuming that resting GTP is lower and that GTP changes less during dialysis with GTP-free solution&#x02014;for example a resting GTP level of 10 &#x003bc;M and a final GTP level of 2 &#x003bc;M, instead of 50 and 1 &#x003bc;M (see ). We lack information on reverse reactions such as the dissociation of G&#x000b7;nucleotide complexes or the possible dissociation of the G&#x003b1;&#x000b7;GTP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> complex by a mechanism other than the classical GTPase reaction.

Experimentally, with Mg<sup>2+</sup> present, there is no measurable dissociation of GTP&#x003b3;S from G<sub>o</sub> or G<sub>i</sub> in 36 min, whereas in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, it dissociates in &#x0223c;2 min from G<sub>o</sub> and &#x0223c;5 min from G<sub>i</sub> (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Higashijima et al., 1987b</xref>). The crystal structures of GTP&#x003b3;S-bound G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub>, G&#x003b1;<sub>s</sub>, and transducin include a single Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion coordinated between the &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; phosphates of GTP and two amino acid hydroxyls of the G-protein (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sprang, 1997</xref>). In our kinetic model, the on-rate for Mg<sup>2+</sup> to form the G&#x000b7;GTP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> complex is 3,000 M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Hence, with the normal 2.1 mM free Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the reaction would occur in only 150 ms, but with free Mg<sup>2+</sup> reduced to 1 &#x003bc;M, it would take 333 s. This is the origin of slowed and delayed muscarinic inhibition in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. During this long wait, the nucleotide would dissociate and rebind to the G-protein numerous times, much as was described for GDP&#x003b2;S. At high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, the overall reaction might involve binding of Mg<sup>2+</sup> first or direct binding of Mg<sup>2+</sup>&#x000b7;GTP, rather than a two-step reaction (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Birnbaumer et al., 1985</xref>).</p><p>The absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> also slows recovery from muscarinic inhibition. Several Mg<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive steps could be implicated. One is the GTPase step of the G&#x000b7;GTP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> complex (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Higashijima et al., 1987b</xref>) and the others are the lipid kinase steps that synthesize PIP<sub>2</sub> from PI (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Porter et al., 1988</xref>). None is as fully characterized as the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent step of G-protein activation. One problem in much of the literature is that assays are developed to optimize the amounts of ATP, total Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and other ingredients but do not consider the resulting free Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In our reading, it is not definitively known whether the GTPase step has Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence in addition to that for initial formation of the G&#x000b7;GTP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> substrate. Nevertheless, in our model, steps 30 and 40 both need Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Step 30 generates the initial G&#x003b1;&#x000b7;GTP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> complex, and step 40 hydrolyzes the GTP. In step 40, the rate of reaction is proportional to a saturation function of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, as if the G&#x003b1;&#x000b7;GTP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> complex reequilibrates with the ambient Mg<sup>2+</sup> before the hydrolysis. As hydrolysis is relatively fast, perhaps such reequilibration has too little time to occur and the saturation function should be deleted. Perhaps instead, the much longer-lived complexes formed in steps 32, 33, or 34 should reequilibrate with the free Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and, e.g., the intrinsic activity of a G&#x003b1;&#x000b7;GTP&#x003b3;S complex might change whether the Mg<sup>2+</sup> is bound or not. Although the overall model predictions are in the right direction, there are too many unknowns about Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence today to test such ideas well.</p></sec><sec><title>PI Metabolism</title><p>We take as a given that muscarinic suppression of KCNQ current entails significant depletion of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the membrane followed by dissociation of PIP<sub>2</sub> from binding sites on the channel. This hypothesis is supported by many recent electrophysiological and pharmacological experiments (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Suh and Hille, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ford et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Loussouarn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). We also suppose that gradual rundown and incomplete recovery of KCNQ current after whole-cell recording starts is in part due to decline and incomplete restoration in PIP<sub>2</sub> levels. For example, some of the PI 4-kinase enzyme is soluble (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 1997</xref>), and during whole-cell recording the available pool of this enzyme might fall as molecules are lost into the recording pipette. However, the recent literature reveals many factors other than PIP<sub>2</sub> that affect the amplitude of KCNQ currents, so the full explanation of rundown and incomplete recovery is undoubtedly more complex.</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot adopt ready-made kinetics of PI turnover from the biochemical literature. The difficulties include that: measurements of total lipids from cells do not separate contributions of different lipid pools (both on different membranes and locally on the plasma membrane itself); measurements often determine total amounts better than fluxes through pools; different cell types and compartments have different lipid kinases and phosphatases; isotopic measurements of pool sizes may suffer from changes of specific activity; and in vitro enzymological experiments with purified components rarely involve physiological forms of the lipid substrates in a native membrane.</p><p>Finding a range of differing views in the literature, we tentatively chose a simple textbook kinetic scheme. Our linear PI-PIP-PIP<sub>2</sub> scheme has no regulation of the lipid-kinase steps other than the requirement for substrates (lipid and ATP) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> cofactor, and PI is considered invariant. Up-regulation of lipid kinases during PLC activation needs to be added when its mechanism and properties become better known. Thus, the literature says that G<sub>q</sub>-coupled receptor stimulation can potentiate lipid kinases by unknown mechanisms (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Yorek et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2003</xref>), that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation can turn off PIP 5-kinase (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2001</xref>), that several ADP-ribosylation-factor (ARF)-dependent pathways can regulate PIP-5-kinase (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aikawa and Martin, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Krauss et al., 2003</xref>), and that GTP&#x003b3;S can potentiate by activating Rac-1 and RhoA (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Tolias and Carpenter, 2000</xref>) or ARF6 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Krauss et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 1997</xref>). The RhoA pathway is also stimulated by G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub> and conceivably underlies the changes we saw with constitutively active G<sub>13</sub>* in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.</p><p>In the model, we ignored PI 5-phosphate and the possibility of forming PIP<sub>2</sub> from it via a PIP 4-kinase, and we also ignore transfer of PI lipids from other pools by PI transfer proteins. We included one lipid phosphatase, PIP<sub>2</sub> 5-phosphatase, and did not include a PIP 4-phosphatase. The rates of the 5-phosphatase and of resting PLC were made about equal, giving some recycling but not a preponderance of futile cycling at rest. The activation of PLC was linearly proportional to the sum of active G-protein forms, thus presuming that GTP, GTP analogs, and AlF<sub>4</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> give equally active G-proteins. We assume that PLC is completely specific for PIP<sub>2</sub> and does not hydrolyze PI or PIP. We ignore potential regulation of PLC by G&#x003b2;&#x003b3;, cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, or PIP<sub>2</sub> itself. Each of these assumptions might have to be revised.</p><p>As a single example, we can compare our calculations to informative measurements made with [<sup>3</sup>H]inositol of total membrane inositol lipids in the SH-SY5Y cell line (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Willars et al., 1998</xref>). We have general agreement on the time course of PIP<sub>2</sub> decay after muscarinic agonist and after inhibiting PI 4-kinase with wortmannin, as well as on the time course of PIP<sub>2</sub> recovery after removing agonist. However, we do not reproduce two of their findings, namely that total PIP falls as fast as PIP<sub>2</sub> with agonist and that PIP<sub>2</sub> recovers much faster than total PIP after removal of agonist. In addition their measurements showed that 15% of the resting PIP<sub>2</sub> is in an agonist-insensitive pool.</p><p>There is little information about the rate of association and dissociation of PIP<sub>2</sub> from binding sites on membrane proteins or about the number of lipid molecules bound per protein. Our assumption that these reactions equilibrate in a few seconds adds a short delay to the response of KCNQ channels. We were not able to get strong suppression of KCNQ channels without assuming that (local) PIP<sub>2</sub> itself is strongly depleted. An extremely cooperative activation of KCNQ channels could make current turn off suddenly as PIP<sub>2</sub> was falling, but it would make the dose&#x02013;response curve for oxo-M too sharp and the time course of suppression by GTP analogues and AlF<sub>4</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> even more sigmoid. We assume that the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding sites do not bind other acidic lipids significantly.</p><p>In summary, many features of the coupling from M<sub>1</sub> receptors to KCNQ current suppression are rationalized by the classical view of heterotrimeric G-protein cycling and PI turnover. So far as they can be compared, the properties of isolated systems, of this expression system in tsA cells, and of native neurons seem largely comparable. Much of this could be modeled mathematically using rate constants previously measured biochemically. By requiring precise specification, the model has highlighted numerous points of uncertainty that have received less study. Probably the least satisfactory feature of the kinetic measurements is that they involve a single downstream measure (current) that is mechanistically far removed from the input (agonist). We will need to design kinetic measurements that reveal the time course of many of the intermediates to constrain numerous assumptions better.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Professors Michael Berridge, R.A.

The calculations assumed that before whole-cell dialysis, the tsA cell cytoplasm contained 50 &#x003bc;M GTP, 3 mM ATP, no GDP, and 2.1 mM free Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Upon dialysis, GTP, GTP&#x003b3;S, GppNHp, and GDP&#x003b2;S began to relax exponentially to their pipette values with a 120-s time constant; AlF<sub>4</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> relaxed with an 80-s time constant; and free Mg<sup>2+</sup> changed immediately. We assumed that dialysis started 300 s before the first agonist application&#x02014;or 20 s before time zero in <xref rid="fig17" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>, where agonist was not used. For example, in the control curve of <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref> (symbols), where the agonist is applied at 90 s and the pipette contains 100 &#x003bc;M GTP, the cytoplasmic GTP concentration in micromolar is described by the formula, 50 + 50 &#x000d7; (1 &#x02212; exp(&#x02212;(<italic>t</italic> + 210)/120)), where breakthrough is taken as time <italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;210 s. Because cytoplasm contains reservoirs of bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the cell was not in a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free bath, we assumed that cellular free Mg<sup>2+</sup> never fell below 1 &#x003bc;M in experiments with EDTA rather than to the low nanomolar levels estimated for the pipette solution itself. Similarly, we assumed that cellular GTP fell to 1 &#x003bc;M when the pipette was GTP free. The initial values for PI, PIP, and PIP<sub>2</sub> were 200,000, 1,150, and 5,000 molecules &#x003bc;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. PI and GDP were held constant at their initial values throughout.</p><p>Except for <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref> A, the application and removal of oxo-M was assumed to follow an exponential time course. Thus, during agonist application, which starts at <italic>t</italic> = 2 in <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> B, the rise of oxo-M in micromolar was described by 10 &#x000d7; (1 &#x02212; exp(&#x02212;(<italic>t</italic> &#x02212; 2)/2.4)). We arbitrarily took the density of G<sub>q</sub> on the membrane as 200 &#x003bc;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. This value has no effect on the calculations since activation of PLC was proportional to the fraction of active G-proteins rather than the number. The fraction of active G-proteins (<italic>f</italic>
<sub>Gactive</sub>) was taken as (G&#x000b7;GTP&#x000b7; Mg<sup>2+</sup> + G&#x000b7;GTP&#x003b3;S&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> + G&#x000b7;GppNHp&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> + G&#x000b7;GDP&#x000b7;AlF<sub>4</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup>)/200, which assumes that all four forms have equal intrinsic activity. The density of PIP<sub>2</sub> binding sites (on KCNQ channels) was taken as 40 &#x003bc;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>; the only significant property of this number is that it is several orders of magnitude lower than the resting PIP<sub>2</sub> density, so that channels do not deplete the PIP<sub>2</sub> pool. To allow some cooperativity for activation of KCNQ current by PIP<sub>2</sub>, the current varied as a power law (<italic>n</italic> = 1.8) of the time-varying fractional site occupancy.</p></app></app-group></back></article>
