    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>The notion of feedback is fundamental for understanding
                            signal transduction networks. Feedback loops attenuate or
                            amplify signals, change the network dynamics and modify the
                            input-output relationships between the signal and the target.
                            Negative feedback provides robustness to noise and adaptation
                            to perturbations, but as a double-edged sword can prevent
                            effective pathway inhibition by a drug. Positive feedback
                            brings about switch-like network responses and can convert
                            analog input signals into digital outputs, triggering cell fate
                            decisions and phenotypic changes. We show how a multitude of
                            protein-protein interactions creates hidden feedback loops in
                            signal transduction cascades. Drug treatments that interfere
                            with feedback regulation can cause unexpected adverse effects.
                            Combinatorial molecular interactions generated by pathway
                            crosstalk and feedback loops often bypass the block caused by
                            targeted therapies against oncogenic mutated kinases. We
                            discuss mechanisms of drug resistance caused by network
                            adaptations and suggest that development of effective drug
                            combinations requires understanding of how feedback loops
                            modulate drug responses.</p>
