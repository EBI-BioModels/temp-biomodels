Abstract: 

In recent years, it became clear that a better understanding of the interactions among the main elements involved in the cancer network is necessary for the treatment of cancer and the suppression of cancer growth. In this work we propose a system of coupled differential equations that model brain tumour under treatment by chemotherapy, which considers interactions among the glial cells, the glioma, the neurons, and the chemotherapeutic agents. We study the conditions for the glioma growth to be eliminated, and identify values of the parameters for which the inhibition of the glioma growth is obtained with a minimal loss of healthy cells.
