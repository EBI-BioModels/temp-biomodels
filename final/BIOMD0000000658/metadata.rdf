    &lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="bibo:abstract"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Wnt signaling plays an important role in both oncogenesis
    and development. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in
    stabilization of the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin.
    Recent studies have demonstrated that axin, which coordinates
    beta-catenin degradation, is itself degraded. Although the key
    molecules required for transducing a Wnt signal have been
    identified, a quantitative understanding of this pathway has
    been lacking. We have developed a mathematical model for the
    canonical Wnt pathway that describes the interactions among the
    core components: Wnt, Frizzled, Dishevelled, GSK3beta, APC,
    axin, beta-catenin, and TCF. Using a system of differential
    equations, the model incorporates the kinetics of
    protein-protein interactions, protein synthesis/degradation,
    and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. We initially defined a
    reference state of kinetic, thermodynamic, and flux data from
    experiments using Xenopus extracts. Predictions based on the
    analysis of the reference state were used iteratively to
    develop a more refined model from which we analyzed the effects
    of prolonged and transient Wnt stimulation on beta-catenin and
    axin turnover. We predict several unusual features of the Wnt
    pathway, some of which we tested experimentally. An insight
    from our model, which we confirmed experimentally, is that the
    two scaffold proteins axin and APC promote the formation of
    degradation complexes in very different ways. We can also
    explain the importance of axin degradation in amplifying and
    sharpening the Wnt signal, and we show that the dependence of
    axin degradation on APC is an essential part of an
    unappreciated regulatory loop that prevents the accumulation of
    beta-catenin at decreased APC concentrations. By applying
    control analysis to our mathematical model, we demonstrate the
    modular design, sensitivity, and robustness of the Wnt pathway
    and derive an explicit expression for tumor suppression and
    oncogenicity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
