    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>While mathematical models are often used to predict
    progression of cancer and treatment outcomes, there is still
    uncertainty over how to best model tumor growth. Seven ordinary
    differential equation (ODE) models of tumor growth
    (exponential, Mendelsohn, logistic, linear, surface, Gompertz,
    and Bertalanffy) have been proposed, but there is no clear
    guidance on how to choose the most appropriate model for a
    particular cancer.We examined all seven of the previously
    proposed ODE models in the presence and absence of
    chemotherapy. We derived equations for the maximum tumor size,
    doubling time, and the minimum amount of chemotherapy needed to
    suppress the tumor and used a sample data set to compare how
    these quantities differ based on choice of growth model.We find
    that there is a 12-fold difference in predicting doubling times
    and a 6-fold difference in the predicted amount of chemotherapy
    needed for suppression depending on which growth model was
    used.Our results highlight the need for careful consideration
    of model assumptions when developing mathematical models for
    use in cancer treatment planning.</p>
