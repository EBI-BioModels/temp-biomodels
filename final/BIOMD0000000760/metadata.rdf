Abstract: In this paper, we develop a theoretical contribution towards the understanding of the complex behavior of conjoint tumor-normal cell growth under the influence of immuno-chemotheraputic agents under simple immune system response. In particular, we consider a core model for the interaction of tumor cells with the surrounding normal cells. We then add the effects of a simple immune system, and both immune-suppression factors and immuno-chemotherapeutic agents as well. Through a series of numerical simulations, we illustrate that the interdependency of tumor-normal cells, together with choice of drug and the nature of the immunodeficiency, leads to a variety of interesting patterns in the evolution of both the tumor and the normal cell populations.
