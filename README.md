# temp-biomodels
Temporary place for coordination of updating existing Biomodels.

The goals of the project are to:
* Add new elements to biomodels omex files (such as output files and annotation RDF files)
* Fix existing elements of omex files (such as the SED-ML)
* Fill in any gaps we can (such as missing SED-ML files)
